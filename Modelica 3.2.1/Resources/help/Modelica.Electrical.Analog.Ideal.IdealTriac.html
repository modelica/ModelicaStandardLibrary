<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This is an ideal triac model based on an ideal thyristor
model.</p>
<p>Two ideal thyristors
(Modelica.Electrical.Analog.Ideal.IdealThyristor) are contrarily
connected in parallel and additionally eliminated interference with
a resistor (Rdis=100) and a capacitor (Cdis=0.005), which are
connected in series.</p>
<p>The electrical component triac (TRIode Alternating Current
switch) is, due to whose complex structure, a multifunctional
applicable construction unit. The application area of this element
is the manipulation of alternating current signals in frequency,
voltage and/or current and also general blocking or filtering.
However, compared to a thyristor the triac is only applied for
substantial lesser currents, what is justified by whose sensitive
structure. Generally one is limited to maximal voltages from 800
volt and currents from 40 ampere. For comparison maximal voltages
of a thyristor are 8.000 volt and currents 5.000 ampere.</p>
<p>Structure and functionality:</p>
<p>Functionality of a triac is in principle the same like
functionality of a thyristor, even connecting through of current
starting from a certain voltage (knee voltage), but only if the
current at anode and cathode is caused by a impulse current in the
gate electrode. In case of the triac this process is also possible
with reverse polarity, wherefore it is possible to control both
half-waves of alternating currents. By means of gate electrodes,
which are connected in a triac and why only one gate electrode is
necessary, the point of time can be determined, at which the triac
lets the alternating current signal pass. Thereby it is possible to
affect the phase, at which the alternating current signal is cut.
One speaks also of phase-angle control. Also depending on doping
and specific structure knee voltage and maximal current carrying
are alterable.</p>
<p>Characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>high switching times between on-state and off state up to
activation of the reverse current phase</li>
<li>gate electrode are activated with (positive) impulse (called
thyristor/triac firing), after firing thyristor path holds itself
in state of low resistance or conductive state up to holding
voltage is fallen below, it follows change to off state and next
thyristor path can fire</li>
<li>in particular by switching of inductive components triacs
generate harmonic waves, whose frequency ranges into broadcast
sector and could there cause transmission disturbances; therefore
triacs have to eliminate interference by inductors and
capacitors</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>any stepless exposure (dimmer)</li>
<li>engine speed adjustment of electric motors</li>
<li>further applications of phase-angle control (power
electronics)</li>
<li>power packs</li>
</ul>
<p>As an additional information: this model is based on the
Modelica.Electrical.Analog.Ideal.IdealThyristor.</p>
