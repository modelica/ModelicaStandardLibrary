<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Library <b>MultiBody</b> is a <b>free</b> Modelica package
providing 3-dimensional mechanical components to model in a
convenient way <b>mechanical systems</b>, such as robots,
mechanisms, vehicles. A basic feature is that all components have
<b>animation</b> information with appropriate default sizes and
colors. A typical screenshot of the animation of a double pendulum
is shown in the figure below, together with its schematic.</p>

<p>Note, that all components - the coordinate system of the world
frame, the gravity acceleration vector, the revolute joints and the
bodies - are visualized in the animation.<br />
This library replaces the long available
ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody library, since it is much more easier
to use and more powerful. The main features of the library are:</p>
<ul>
<li>About <b>60 main components</b>, i.e., joint, force, part,
body, sensor and visualizer components that are ready to use and
have useful default animation properties. One-dimensional force
laws can be defined with components of the
Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational and of the
Modelica.Mechanics.Translational library and can be connected via
available flange connectors to MultiBody components.</li>
<li>About <b>75 functions</b> to operate in a convenient way on
orientation objects, e.g., to transform vector quantities between
frames, or compute the orientation object of a planar rotation. The
basic idea is to hide the actual definition of an
<b>orientation</b> by providing essentially an <b>Orientation</b>
type together with <b>functions</b> operating on instances of this
type. Orientation objects based on a 3x3 transformation matrix and
on quaternions are provided. As a side effect, the equations in all
other components are simpler and easier to understand.</li>
<li><b>A World model</b> has to be present in every model on top
level. Here the gravity field is defined (currently: no gravity,
uniform gravity, point gravity), the visualization of the world
coordinate system and default settings for animation. If a world
model is not present, it is automatically provided together with a
warning message.</li>
<li><b>Built-in animation properties</b> of all components, such as
joints, forces, bodies, sensors. This allows an easy visual check
of the constructed model. Animation of every component can be
switched off via a parameter. The animation of a complete system
can be switched off via one parameter in the <b>world</b> model. If
animation is switched off, all equations related to animation are
removed from the generated code. This is especially important for
real-time simulation.</li>
<li><b>Automatic handling of kinematic loops</b>. Components can be
connected together in a nearly arbitrary fashion. It does not
matter whether components are flipped. This does not influence the
efficiency. If kinematic loop structures occur, this is
automatically handled in an efficient way by a new technique to
transform a certain class of overdetermined sets of differential
algebraic equations symbolically to a system where the number of
equations and unknowns are the same (the user need <b>not</b> cut
loops with special cut-joints to construct a tree-structure).</li>
<li><b>Automatic state selection from joints and bodies</b>. Most
joints and all bodies have potential states. A Modelica translator,
such as Dymola, will use the generalized coordinates of joints as
states if possible. If this is not possible, states are selected
from body coordinates. As a consequence, strange joints with 6
degrees of freedom are not necessary to define a body moving freely
in space. An advanced user may select states manually from the
<b>Advanced</b> menu of the corresponding components or use a
Modelica parameter modification to set the "stateSelect" attribute
directly.</li>
<li><b>Analytic solution of kinematic loops</b>. The non-linear
equations occurring in kinematic loops are solved
<b>analytically</b> for a large class of mechanisms, such as a 4
bar mechanism, a slider-crank mechanism or a MacPherson suspension.
This is performed by constructing such loops with assembly joints
JointXXX, available in the Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Joints
package. Assembly joints consist of 3 joints that have together 6
degrees of freedom, i.e., no constraints.They do not have potential
states. When the motion of the two frame connectors are provided, a
non-linear system of equation is solved analytically to compute the
motion of the 3 joints. Analytic loop handling is especially
important for real-time simulation.</li>
<li><b>Line force components may have mass</b>. Masses of line
force components are located on the line on which the force is
acting. They approximate the mass properties of a real physical
device by one or two point masses. For example, a spring has often
significant mass that has to be taken into account. If masses are
set to zero, the additional code to handle these point masses is
removed. If the masses are taken into account, the calculation
overhead is small (the reason is that the occurring kinematic loops
are analytically solved).</li>
<li><b>Force components may be connected directly together</b>,
e.g., 3-dimensional springs in series connection. Usually,
multi-body programs have the restriction that force components can
only be connected between two bodies. Such restrictions are not
present in the Modelica multi-body library, since it is a fully
object-oriented, equation based library. Usually, if force
components are connected directly together, non-linear systems of
equations occur. The advantage is often, that this may avoid stiff
systems that would occur if a small mass has to be put in between
the two force elements.</li>
<li><b>Initialization definition is available via menus</b>.
Initialization of states in joints and bodies can be performed in
the parameter menu, <b>without</b> typing Modelica statements. For
non-standard initialization, the usual Modelica commands can be
used.</li>
<li><b>Multi-body specific error messages</b>. Annotations and
assert statements have been introduced that provide in many cases
warning or error messages that are related to the library
components (and not to specific equations as it is usual in
Modelica libraries). This requires appropriate tool support, as it
is, e.g., available in Dymola.</li>
<li><b>Inverse models</b> of mechanical systems can be easily
defined by using motion generators, e.g.,
Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Position. Also, non-standard inverse
models can be generated, e.g., when elasticity is present it might
be necessary to differentiate equations several times.</li>
</ul>
