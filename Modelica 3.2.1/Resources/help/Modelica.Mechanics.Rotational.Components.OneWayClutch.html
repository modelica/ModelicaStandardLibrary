<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This component models a <b>one-way clutch</b>, i.e., a component
with two flanges where friction is present between the two flanges
and these flanges are pressed together via a normal force. These
flanges maybe sliding with respect to each other Parallel
connection of ClutchCombi and of FreeWheel. The element is
introduced to resolve the ambiguity of the constraint torques of
the elements.</p>
<p>A one-way-clutch is an element where a clutch is connected in
parallel to a free wheel. This special element is provided, because
such a parallel connection introduces an ambiguity into the model
(the constraint torques are not uniquely defined when both elements
are stuck) and this element resolves it by introducing <b>one</b>
constraint torque and not two.</p>
<p>Note, initial values have to be chosen for the model, such that
the relative speed of the one-way-clutch &gt;= 0. Otherwise, the
configuration is physically not possible and an error occurs.</p>
<p>The normal force fn has to be provided as input signal
f_normalized in a normalized form (0 ≤ f_normalized ≤ 1), fn =
fn_max*f_normalized, where fn_max has to be provided as parameter.
Friction in the clutch is modelled in the following way:</p>
<p>When the relative angular velocity is positive, the friction
torque is a function of the velocity dependent friction coefficient
mue(w_rel) , of the normal force "fn", and of a geometry constant
"cgeo" which takes into account the geometry of the device and the
assumptions on the friction distributions:</p>
<pre>
        frictional_torque = <b>cgeo</b> * <b>mue</b>(w_rel) * <b>fn</b>
</pre>
<p>Typical values of coefficients of friction:</p>
<pre>
      dry operation   :  <b>mue</b> = 0.2 .. 0.4
      operating in oil:  <b>mue</b> = 0.05 .. 0.1
</pre>
<p>When plates are pressed together, where <b>ri</b> is the inner
radius, <b>ro</b> is the outer radius and <b>N</b> is the number of
friction interfaces, the geometry constant is calculated in the
following way under the assumption of a uniform rate of wear at the
interfaces:</p>
<pre>
         <b>cgeo</b> = <b>N</b>*(<b>r0</b> + <b>ri</b>)/2
</pre>
<p>The positive part of the friction characteristic
<b>mue</b>(w_rel), w_rel &gt;= 0, is defined via table mue_pos
(first column = w_rel, second column = mue). Currently, only linear
interpolation in the table is supported.</p>
<p>When the relative angular velocity becomes zero, the elements
connected by the friction element become stuck, i.e., the relative
angle remains constant. In this phase the friction torque is
calculated from a torque balance due to the requirement, that the
relative acceleration shall be zero. The elements begin to slide
when the friction torque exceeds a threshold value, called the
maximum static friction torque, computed via:</p>
<pre>
       frictional_torque = <b>peak</b> * <b>cgeo</b> * <b>mue</b>(w_rel=0) * <b>fn</b>   (<b>peak</b> &gt;= 1)
</pre>
<p>This procedure is implemented in a "clean" way by state events
and leads to continuous/discrete systems of equations if friction
elements are dynamically coupled. The method is described in:</p>
