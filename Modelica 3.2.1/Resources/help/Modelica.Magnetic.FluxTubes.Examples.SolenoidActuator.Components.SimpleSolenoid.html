<p>Please refer to the <b>Parameters</b> section for a schematic
drawing of this axisymmetric lifting magnet. In the half-section
below, the flux tube elements of the actuator's magnetic circuit
are superimposed on a field plot obtained with FEA. The
magnetomotive force imposed by the coil is modelled as one lumped
element. As a result, the radial leakage flux between armature and
yoke that occurs especially at large working air gaps can not be
considered properly. This leads to a a higher total reluctance and
lower inductance respectively compared to FEA for large working air
gaps (i.e., armature close to x_max). Please have a look at the
comments associated with the individual model components for a
short explanation of their purpose in the model.</p>

<p>The coupling coefficient c_coupl in the coil is set to 1 in this
example, since leakage flux is accounted for explicitly with the
flux tube element G_mLeakWork. Although this leakage model is
rather simple, it describes the reluctance force due to the leakage
field sufficiently, especially at large air gaps. With decreasing
air gap length, the influence of the leakage flux on the actuator's
net reluctance force decreases due to the increasing influence of
the main working air gap G_mAirWork.</p>
<p>During model-based actuator design, the radii and lengths of the
flux tube elements (and hence their cross-sectional areas and flux
densities) should be assigned with parametric equations so that
common design rules are met (e.g., allowed flux density in
ferromagnetic parts, allowed current density and required
cross-sectional area of winding). For simplicity, those equations
are omitted in the example. Instead, the found values are assigned
to the model elements directly.</p>
