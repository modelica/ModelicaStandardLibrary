<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>The control valves in <a href="Modelica.Fluid.Valves.html">Modelica.Fluid.Valves</a> have
the parameters <b>Kv</b> and <b>Cv</b>. They are defined as
unit-less variables, but in the description text a unit is given.
The reason for this definition is the following:</p>
<p>The basic equation for valves is:</p>
<pre>
  q = Av*sqrt(dp/rho)
</pre>
<p>In SI units, [q] is m3/s, [dp] is Pascal, [rho] is [kg/m3], and
Av is an area, thus [Av] = m2. Basically, the equation stems from
Bernoulli's law. Av is roughly 1.4 times the area of the valve
throat. Now, usually valves aren't so big that their throat area is
of the order of magnitude of square meters - depending on the
applications it is from a few square millimeters to a few square
centimeters. Therefore, in the common engineering practice, the
following equations are used:</p>
<p>Europe:</p>
<pre>
  q = Kv sqrt(dp/(rho/rho0)) , with [q] = m3/h, [dp] = bar
</pre>
<p>US:</p>
<pre>
  q = Cv sqrt(dp/(rho/rho0)) , with [q] = USG/min, [dp] = psi
</pre>
<p>In both cases rho0 is the density of cold water at 4 °C, 999
kg/m3. Note that these equations use relative, not absolute
densities.</p>
<p>It turns out that Kv = 1e6/27.7*Av and Cv = 1e6/24*Av, so both
US and EU engineers get more or less the same numbers (just by
sheer luck), with a range between a few units and a few hundred
units for typical industrial applications, and everybody is
happy.</p>
<p>Now, we've got two problems here. First, depending on the unit,
we change the equation: with SI units, we use the density, with
non-SI units, we use the relative density. So the quantities (not
only the units!) of Av and Cv/Kv are different.</p>
<p>Second, the units of Kv and Cv are usually labeled "m3/h" and
"USG/min", but as a matter of fact they are different, as can be
seen from the equations above: they are actually m3/(h*sqrt(bar))
and USG/(min*sqrt(psi)). If I have a valve with Kv = 10 m3/h, it
means I get 10 m3/h "for a pressure drop of 1 bar". Unfortunately,
this is not correct from the point of view of strict dimensional
analysis, but nobody uses sqrt(Pa) or sqrt(bar).</p>
<p>You might think this is crazy (it is, especially when you try to
explain it), but as a matter of fact the valve coefficient is
<b>never</b> given in square meters in any catalog or datasheet; Cv
is still the most used (even in Europe), followed by Kv. So, it
will be very inconvenient for users to type in Av in square
meters.</p>
<p>The pragmatic approach used in Modelica.Fluid.ControlValves is
to accept the fact that m3/h and USG/min are not the real units of
Cv and Kv, so we can't use the general unit conversion mechanism,
put them just as mnemonic labels in the comment, use
non-dimensional coefficients in the interface, and then define
properly dimensioned unit conversion within the model</p>
