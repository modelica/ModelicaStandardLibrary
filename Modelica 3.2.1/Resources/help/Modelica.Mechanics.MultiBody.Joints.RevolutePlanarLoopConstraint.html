<p>Joint where frame_b rotates around axis n which is fixed in
frame_a and where this joint is used in a planar loop providing 2
constraint equations on position level.</p>
<p>If a <b>planar loop</b> is present, e.g., consisting of 4
revolute joints where the joint axes are all parallel to each
other, then there is no unique mathematical solution if all
revolute joints are modelled with Joints.Revolute and the symbolic
algorithms will fail. The reason is that, e.g., the cut-forces in
the revolute joints perpendicular to the planar loop are not
uniquely defined when 3-dim. descriptions of revolute joints are
used. Usually, an error message will be printed pointing out this
situation. In this case, <b>one</b> revolute joint in the loop has
to be replaced by model Joints.RevolutePlanarLoopCutJoint. The
effect is that from the 5 constraints of a 3-dim. revolute joint, 3
constraints are removed and replaced by appropriate known variables
(e.g., the force in the direction of the axis of rotation is
treated as known with value equal to zero; for standard revolute
joints, this force is an unknown quantity).</p>
