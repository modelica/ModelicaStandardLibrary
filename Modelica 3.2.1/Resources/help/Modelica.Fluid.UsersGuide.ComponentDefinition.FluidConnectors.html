<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>In this section the design of the fluid connectors is
explained.</p>
<p>Fluid connectors represent the points in a device (e.g., the
flanges) through which a fluid can flow into or out of the
component, carrying its thermodynamic properties; these flanges are
assumed to be fixed in space.</p>
<p>A major design goal is that components can be arbitrarily
connected and that the important balance equations are
automatically fulfilled when 2 or more components are connected
together at one point as shown in the next figure:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Fluid/UsersGuide/MixingConnections.png" alt="MixingConnections.png" /></p>
<p>In such a case the balance equations define <b>ideal mixing</b>,
i.e., the upstream discretization scheme of each component uses
values that result from ideal mixing in an infinitely small time
period. If more realistic modelling is desired that takes into
account mixing losses, an explicit model has to be used in the
connection point.</p>
<h4>Single substance media</h4>
<p>For a single substance medium, the connector definition in
Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort reduces to</p>
<pre>
  <b>connector</b> FluidPort
     <b>replaceable package</b> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
              "Medium model of the fluid";
     <b>flow</b> Medium.MassFlowRate m_flow;
              "Mass flow rate from the connection point into the component";
     Medium.AbsolutePressure p
              "Thermodynamic pressure in the connection point";
     <b>stream</b> Medium.SpecificEnthalpy h_outflow
               "Specific thermodynamic enthalpy close to the connection point if m_flow &lt; 0";
  <b>end</b> FluidPort;
</pre>
<p>The first statement defines the Medium flowing through the
connector. In a medium, medium specific types such as
"Medium.AbsolutePressure" are defined that contain medium specific
values for the min, max and nominal attributes. Furthermore,
Medium.MassFlowRate is defined as:</p>
<pre>
   <b>type</b> MassFlowRate =
      Modelica.SIunits.MassFlowRate(quantity="MassFlowRate." + mediumName);
</pre>
<p>With the current library design, it is necessary to explicitly
select the medium model for each component in a circuit. This model
is then propagated to the ports, and a Modelica translator will
check that the quantity and unit attributes of connected interfaces
are identical. Therefore, an error occurs, if connected FluidPorts
do not have a medium with the same medium name. In the future,
automatic propagation of fluid models through the ports will be
introduced, but this still not possible with Modelica 3.0.</p>
<p>The thermodynamic pressure is an <i>effort</i> variable, which
means that the connection of two or more ports states that the port
pressures are the same.</p>
<p>The mass flow rate is a <i>flow</i> variable, which means that
the connection of two or more ports states that the sum of all flow
rates is zero.</p>
<p>The last variable is a <i>stream</i> variable, i.e., a specific
quantity carried by the flow variable. The quantity on the
connector always corresponds to the value close to the connection
point, assuming that the fluid is flowing out of the connector,
regardless of the actual direction of the flow. This helps avoiding
singularities when the mass flow goes through zero. The stream
properties for the other flow direction can be inquired with the
built-in operator inStream(..), while the value of the stream
variable corresponding to the actual flow direction can be inquired
through the built-in operator actualStream(..).</p>
<p>The actual equations corresponding to these operators are
introduced and solved automatically by the tool. In principle, they
correspond to the balance equation sum(flow_variable) = 0 and
sum(flow_variable*stream_variable_at_connection) = 0 applied to the
set of connected ports. In this case the first equation is the mass
balance sum(m_flow) = 0, and the second is the energy balance at
the connection point sum(m_flow*h_connection) = 0.</p>
<p>In the simpler case of a one-to-one connections between port_a
and port_b, inStream(port_a.h_outflow) just returns
port_b.h_outflow. For multiple-way connections, mixing equations
are generated, and special care is taken in order to avoid
discontinuities around zero flow rates. For more details, see this
<a href="../../../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Documentation/Fluid/Stream-Connectors-Overview-Rationale.pdf">
presentation</a> which illustrates the stream concept rationale and
the underlying technicalities.</p>
<p>A connector should have only the minimal number of variables to
describe the interface, otherwise there will be connection
restrictions in certain cases. Therefore, in the connector no
redundant variables are present, e.g., the temperature T is not
present because it can be computed from the connector variables
pressure p and specific enthalpy h.</p>
<p>Here are two simple examples to illustrate modeling with stream
connectors. The first one is a rigid adiabatic volume mixing two
flows, where the kinetic and gravitational terms in the energy
balance are neglected for simplicity.</p>
<pre>
model MixingVolume "Volume that mixes two flows"
  replaceable package Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialPureSubstance;
  FluidPort port_a, port_b;
  parameter Modelica.SIunits.Volume V "Volume of device";
  Modelica.SIunits.Mass             m "Mass in device";
  Modelica.SIunits.Energy           U "Inner energy in device";
  Medium.BaseProperties medium(preferredMediumStates=true) "Medium in the device";
equation
  // Definition of port variables
  port_a.p         = medium.p;
  port_b.p         = medium.p;
  port_a.h_outflow = medium.h;  // The stream variable always corresponds to the
  port_b.h_outflow = medium.h;  // properties of the fluid holdup (outgoing flow)

  // Total quantities
  m = V*medium.d;
  U = m*medium.u;
   // Mass and energy balance (actualStream(..) is a built-in operator for streams to
  // compute the right h, depending on the flow direction)
  der(m) = port_a.m_flow + port_b.m_flow;
  der(U) = port_a.m_flow*actualStream(port_a.h_outflow) +
           port_b.m_flow*actualStream(port_b.h_outflow);
end MixingVolume;
</pre>
<p>The second example is the model of a component describing a
lumped pressure loss between two ports, with no energy storage and
no heat transfer. An isenthalpic transformation is assumed (changes
in kinetic and potential energy between inlet and outlet are
neglected)</p>
<pre>
model PressureLoss "Pressure loss component"
  replaceable package Medium=Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialPureSubstance;
  FluidPort port_a, port_b:
  Medium.ThermodynamicState port_a_state_inflow "State at port_a if inflowing";
  Medium.ThermodynamicState port_b_state_inflow "State at port_b if inflowing";
  Medium density d_a, d_b "Density at ports a and b if inflowing";
  replaceable function f "Function to compute the mass flow rate";
equation
  // Medium states for inflowing fluid
  port_a_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_a.p, inStream(port_a.h_outflow));
  port_b_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_b.p, inStream(port_b.h_outflow));
  // Mass balance
  0 = port_a.m_flow + port_b.m_flow;
  // Instantaneous propagation of enthalpy flow between the ports with
  // isenthalpic state transformation (no storage and no loss of energy)
  port_a.h_outflow = inStream(port_b.h_outflow);
  port_b.h_outflow = inStream(port_a.h_outflow);
  // (Regularized) Momentum balance
  port_a.m_flow = f(port_a.p, port_b.p, d_a, d_b);
end PressureLoss;
</pre>
<p>If many such components are connected in series between two
models with storage, the specific enthalpies are propagated in both
directions and available to all pressure loss components, without
problems when the mass flow goes through zero. The function f then
uses either d_a or d_b depending on the sign of port_a.p-port_b.p,
with a suitable regularization around zero to avoid
discontinuities.</p>
<p>Please note that these models are highly idealized in order to
explain the stream connector concept. Device models in the library
are much more complete, handling issues such as initialization,
steady vs. dynamic modelling, heat transfer from the outside,
etc.</p>
<h4>Multiple-substance media</h4>
<p>Modelica.Fluid can handle models where the fluid contains
multiple substances, so that its composition can be characterized
by mass fraction vectors.</p>
<pre>
<b>connector</b> FluidPort
   <b>replaceable package</b> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
      "Medium model of the fluid";
   <b>flow</b> Medium.MassFlowRate m_flow;
      "Mass flow rate from the connection point into the component"
   Medium.AbsolutePressure p
      "Thermodynamic pressure in the connection point";
   <b>stream</b> Medium.SpecificEnthalpy h_outflow
       "Specific thermodynamic enthalpy close to the connection point if m_flow &lt; 0";
   <b>stream</b> Medium.MassFraction Xi_outflow[Medium.nXi]
       "Independent mixture mass fractions m_i/m close to the connection point if m_flow &lt; 0";
   <b>stream</b> Medium.ExtraProperty C_outflow[Medium.nC]
       "Properties c_i/m close to the connection point if m_flow &lt; 0";
  <b>end</b> FluidPort;
</pre>
The mass fraction vectors Xi and C are also stream quantities, as
they are carried by the mass flow rate. The corresponding
connection equations are sum(m_flow*Xi) and sum(m_flow*C), which
correspond to mass balances for the single substances. The vector
Xi contains the mass fractions of the main components of the fluid,
and is used together with p and h to determine the thermodynamic
state of the fluid. The vector C contains the mass fraction of the
trace components, which are accounted for in mass balances, but is
ignored when computing the fluid properties. This allows to easily
declare and use medium models with trace components starting from
existing medium models (e.g., adding CO<sub>2</sub> traces to Moist
Air for air conditioning models).
<h4>Approximations in balance equations at connection point</h4>
<p>Summing up, when two or more ports of the type FluidPort are
connected, the following equations are generated by the tool:</p>
<pre>
sum(port_j.m_flow) = 0;               // Total Mass balance
port_j = port_k;                      // Momentum balance
sum(port_j.m_flow*h_connection) = 0;  // Energy balance
sum(port_j.m_flow*Xi_connection) = 0; // Single component mass balances
sum(port_j.m_flow*C_connection) = 0;  // Trace components mass balances
</pre>
<p>It is <b>very important</b> to bear in mind that</p>
<ul>
<li>the mass balances are always exact;</li>
<li>the momentum and energy balance are only exact when two port
with the same diameter are connected, because there is no friction
and no change in fluid velocity.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all other cases, i.e., different port diameters and/or
multiple port connections:</p>
<ul>
<li>The momentum balance does not consider friction effects and
changes of pressure due to changes in velocity.</li>
<li>There might thus be errors in the momentum balance of the order
of magnitude of the dynamic pressure ρv<sup>2</sup>/2.</li>
<li>The energy balance does not consider the kinetic terms (gravity
terms cancel out due to the infinitesimal size of the connection
volume). There might thus be errors in the momentum balance of the
order of magnitude of the kinetic energy v^2/2.</li>
</ul>
<p>In many applications, where fluid speeds are low and thermal
phenomena are mainly of interest, these approximations are commonly
made and lead to acceptable results. In all other cases, explicit
fitting and junction models should be used, that model explicitly
all the kinetic phenomena with the appropriate level of detail.</p>
