<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This component consists of <b>3 revolute</b> joints with
parallel axes of rotation that are connected together by two rods,
see the default animation in the following figure (the axes vectors
are not part of the default animation):</p>

<p>This joint aggregation introduces neither constraints nor state
variables and should therefore be used in kinematic loops whenever
possible to avoid non-linear systems of equations. It is only
meaningful to use this component in <b>planar loops</b>. Basically,
the position and orientation of the 3 revolute joints as well as of
frame_ia, frame_ib, and frame_im are calculated by solving
analytically a non-linear equation, given the position and
orientation at frame_a and at frame_b.</p>
<p>Connector <b>frame_a</b> is the "left" side of the first
revolute joint whereas <b>frame_ia</b> is the "right side of this
revolute joint, fixed in rod 1. Connector <b>frame_b</b> is the
"right" side of the third revolute joint whereas <b>frame_ib</b> is
the "left" side of this revolute joint, fixed in rod 2. Finally,
connector <b>frame_im</b> is the connector at the "right" side of
the revolute joint in the middle, fixed in rod 2.</p>
<p>The easiest way to define the parameters of this joint is by
moving the MultiBody system in a <b>reference configuration</b>
where <b>all frames</b> of all components are <b>parallel</b> to
each other (alternatively, at least frame_a, frame_ia, frame_im,
frame_ib, frame_b of the JointRRR joint should be parallel to each
other when defining an instance of this component).</p>
<p>Basically, the JointRRR model consists internally of a universal
- spherical - revolute joint aggregation (= JointUSR). In a planar
loop this will behave as if 3 revolute joints with parallel axes
are connected by rigid rods.</p>
