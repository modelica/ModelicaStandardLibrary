<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>The Modelica.Fluid library is designed so that each model of a
system must include an instance <code>system</code> of the
<code>System</code> component at the top level, in the same way as
the <code>World</code> model of the MultiBody Library. The System
component contains the parameters that describe the environment
surrounding the components (ambient pressure and temperature,
gravity acceleration), and also provides default settings for many
parameters which are used consistently by the models in the
library. These parameters are then propagated to the individual
components using the inner/outer variable mechanism. In case the
system model is structured hierarchically, it is possible to either
put a single System component at the top level, or possibly to put
many of them at different levels, which will only influence the
system components from that level down.</p>
<p>All the parameters defined in the System model are used as
default values for the parameters of the individual components of
the system model. Note that it is always possible to override these
defaults locally by changing the value of the parameters in the
specific component instance.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>General</i> tab of the System model allows to set the
default environment variables (pressure, temperature and gravity)
used by all the components.</li>
<li>The <i>Assumptions</i> tab allows to change the default
modelling assumptions used by all the components (see the section
<i>Customizing a system model later</i>)</li>
<li>The <i>Initialization</i> tab allows to define default start
values for mass flow rates, pressures and temperatures in the
model; this can be useful to help nonlinear solver converge to the
solution of any nonlinear system of equations that involves such
variables, by providing meaningful guess values.</li>
<li>The <i>Advanced</i> tab contains default values for parameters
used in the advanced settings of some components.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to <b>always add a System component</b> at the top
level of your system model, otherwise you will get errors when
compiling the model. The tool will automatically name it
<code>system</code>, so that it is recognized by all other
components.</p>
