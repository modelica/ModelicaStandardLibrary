<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This component consists of a <b>universal</b> joint at frame_a,
a <b>spherical</b> joint at frame_b and a <b>prismatic</b> joint
along the line connecting the origin of frame_a and the origin of
frame_b, see the default animation in the following figure (the
axes vectors are not part of the default animation):</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/Joints/JointUPS.png" alt="model Joints.Assemblies.JointUPS" /></p>
<p>This joint aggregation has no mass and no inertia and introduces
neither constraints nor potential state variables. It is especially
useful to build up more complicated force elements where the mass
and/or inertia of the force element shall be taken into
account.</p>
<p>The universal joint is defined in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rotation <b>axis</b> of revolute joint <b>1</b> is along
parameter vector n1_a which is fixed in frame_a.</li>
<li>The rotation <b>axis</b> of revolute joint <b>2</b> is
perpendicular to axis 1 and to the line connecting the universal
and the spherical joint.</li>
</ul>
<p>The definition of axis 2 of the universal joint is performed
according to the most often occurring case. In a future release,
axis 2 might be explicitly definable via a parameter. However, the
treatment is much more complicated and the number of operations is
considerably higher, if axis 2 is not orthogonal to axis 1 and to
the connecting rod.</p>
<p>Note, there is a <b>singularity</b> when axis 1 and the
connecting line are parallel to each other. Therefore, if possible
n1_a should be selected in such a way that it is perpendicular to
nAxis_ia in the initial configuration (i.e., the distance to the
singularity is as large as possible).</p>
<p>An additional <b>frame_ia</b> is present. It is <b>fixed</b> on
the line connecting the universal and the spherical joint at the
origin of <b>frame_a</b>. The placement of frame_ia on this line is
implicitly defined by the universal joint (frame_a and frame_ia
coincide when the angles of the two revolute joints of the
universal joint are zero) and by parameter vector <b>nAxis_ia</b>,
an axis vector directed along the line from the origin of frame_a
to the spherical joint, resolved in frame_<b>ia</b>.</p>
<p>An additional <b>frame_ib</b> is present. It is <b>fixed</b> in
the line connecting the prismatic and the spherical joint at the
origin of <b>frame_b</b>. It is always parallel to
<b>frame_ia</b>.</p>
<p>Note, this joint aggregation can be used in cases where in
reality a rod with spherical joints at each end are present. Such a
system has an additional degree of freedom to rotate the rod along
its axis. In practice this rotation is usually of no interest and
is mathematically removed by replacing one of the spherical joints
by a universal joint.</p>
<p>The easiest way to define the parameters of this joint is by
moving the MultiBody system in a <b>reference configuration</b>
where <b>all frames</b> of all components are <b>parallel</b> to
each other (alternatively, at least frame_a, frame_ia and frame_ib
of the JointUSP joint should be parallel to each other when
defining an instance of this component).</p>
