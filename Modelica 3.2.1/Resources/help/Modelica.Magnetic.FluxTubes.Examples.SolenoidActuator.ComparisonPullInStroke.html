<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Have a look at <a href="Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes.Examples.SolenoidActuator.html">SolenoidActuator</a>
for general comments and at <a href="Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes.Examples.SolenoidActuator.Components.SimpleSolenoid.html">
SimpleSolenoid</a> and <a href="Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes.Examples.SolenoidActuator.Components.AdvancedSolenoid.html">
AdvancedSolenoid</a> for a detailed description of both magnetic
network models.</p>
<p>A voltage step is applied to both solenoid models at time t=0.
The armatures of both models and therewith connected loads are
pulled from their rest position at maximum air gap length to their
minimum position that is due to a stopper. As a reference,
simulation results obtained with a dynamic model based on
stationary FEA look-up tables (not part of this library) are
included. Note that these reference results are valid for the
default supply voltage v_step=12V DC and the default load mass
m_load=0.01kg only!</p>
<p>Set the <b>tolerance</b> to <b>1e-7</b> and <b>simulate for 0.05
s</b>. Plot actuator current, force and position of the two
magnetic network models and the FEA-based reference <b>vs. time</b>
(each quantity in one common plot window):</p>
<pre>
Plot window for current:
    simpleSolenoid.p.i          // rapid current rise indicates low inductance of simple network model
    advancedSolenoid.p.i        // current rise slower, better match with FEA reference
    comparisonWithFEA.y[1]      // current obtained from dynamic model based on stationary FEA look-up tables

Plot window for force:
    simpleSolenoid.armature.flange_a.f       // reluctance force of simple actuator model
    advancedSolenoid.armature.flange_a.f     // reluctance force of advanced actuator model
    comparisonWithFEA.y[2]      // force obtained from dynamic model based on stationary FEA look-up tables

Plot window for position:
    simpleSolenoid.x            // armature position of simple actuator model
    advancedSolenoid.x          // armature position of advanced actuator model
    comparisonWithFEA.y[3]      // position obtained from dynamic model based on stationary FEA look-up tables
</pre>
<p>The characteristic current drop during pull-in is due to both
armature motion and increasing inductance with decreasing air gap
length. Bouncing occurs when armature and load of each model arrive
at the stopper at minimum position. Although the pull-in times of
the two magnetic network models are relatively close to the time
obtained with the reference model, the accuracy of the advanced
solenoid model is better, as one can tell from a comparison of the
current rise at the beginning of the stroke.</p>
