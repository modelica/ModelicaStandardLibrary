<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>The IdealPlanetary gear box is an ideal gear without inertia,
elasticity, damping or backlash consisting of an inner <b>sun</b>
wheel, an outer <b>ring</b> wheel and a <b>planet</b> wheel located
between sun and ring wheel. The bearing of the planet wheel shaft
is fixed in the planet <b>carrier</b>. The component can be
connected to other elements at the sun, ring and/or carrier
flanges. It is not possible to connect to the planet wheel. If
inertia shall not be neglected, the sun, ring and carrier inertias
can be easily added by attaching inertias (= model Inertia) to the
corresponding connectors. The inertias of the planet wheels are
always neglected.</p>
<p>The icon of the planetary gear signals that the sun and carrier
flanges are on the left side and the ring flange is on the right
side of the gear box. However, this component is generic and is
valid independently how the flanges are actually placed (e.g., sun
wheel may be placed on the right side instead on the left side in
reality).</p>
<p>The ideal planetary gearbox is uniquely defined by the ratio of
the number of ring teeth zr with respect to the number of sun teeth
zs. For example, if there are 100 ring teeth and 50 sun teeth then
ratio = zr/zs = 2. The number of planet teeth zp has to fulfill the
following relationship:</p>
<pre>
   <b>zp := (zr - zs) / 2</b>
</pre>
<p>Therefore, in the above example zp = 25 is required.</p>
<p>According to the overall convention, the positive direction of
all vectors, especially the absolute angular velocities and
cut-torques in the flanges, are along the axis vector displayed in
the icon.</p>
