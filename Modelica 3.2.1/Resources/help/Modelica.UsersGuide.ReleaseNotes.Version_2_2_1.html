<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Version 2.2.1 is backward compatible to version 2.2.</p>
<p>In this version, <b>no</b> new libraries have been added. The
following major improvements have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Documentation</b> of the Modelica standard library was
considerably improved:<br />
In Dymola 6, the new feature was introduced to automatically add
tables for class content and component interface definitions
(parameters and connectors) to the info layer. For this reason, the
corresponding (partial) tables previously present in the Modelica
Standard Library have been removed. The new feature of Dymola 6 has
the significant advantage that all tables are now guaranteed to be
up-to-date.<br />
Additionally, the documentation has been improved by adding
appropriate description texts to parameters, connector instances,
function input and output arguments etc., in order that the
automatically generated tables do not have empty entries. Also new
User's Guides for sublibraries Rotational and SIunits have been
added and the User's Guide on top level (Modelica.UsersGuide) has
been improved.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Initialization options have been added to the
Modelica.Blocks.<b>Continuous</b> blocks (NoInit, SteadyState,
InitialState, InitialOutput). If InitialOutput is selected, the
block output is provided as initial condition. The states of the
block are then initialized as close as possible to steady state.
Furthermore, the Continuous.LimPID block has been significantly
improved and much better documented.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Modelica.<b>Media</b> library has been significantly
improved:<br />
New functions setState_pTX, setState_phX, setState_psX,
setState_dTX have been added to PartialMedium to compute the
independent medium variables (= state of medium) from p,T,X, or
from p,h,X or from p,s,X or from d,T,X. Then functions are provided
for all interesting medium variables to compute them from its
medium state. All these functions are implemented in a robust way
for all media (with a few exceptions, if the generic function does
not make sense for a particular medium).</li>
</ul>

<li>All components with animation information have a new variable
<b>specularCoefficient</b> to define the reflection of ambient
light. The default value is world.defaultSpecularCoefficient which
has a default of 0.7. By changing world.defaultSpecularCoefficient,
the specularCoefficient of all components is changed that are not
explicitly set differently. Since specularCoefficient is a variable
(and no parameter), it can be changed during simulation. Since
annotation(Dialog) is set, this variable still appears in the
parameter menus.<br />
Previously, a constant specularCoefficient of 0.7 was used for all
components.</li>
<li>Variable <b>color</b> of all components is no longer a
parameter but an input variable. Also all parameters in package
<b>Visualizers</b>, with the exception of <b>shapeType</b> are no
longer parameters but defined as input variables with
annotation(Dialog). As a result, all these variables appear still
in parameter menus, but they can be changed during simulation
(e.g., color might be used to display the temperature of a
part).</li>
<li>All menus have been changed to follow the Modelica 2.2
annotations "Dialog, group, tab, enable" (previously, a
non-standard Dymola definition for menus was used). Also, the
"enable" annotation is used in all menus to disable input fields if
the input would be ignored.</li>

(to remove them, if animation is switched off). Previously, these
(protected) objects have been defined by arrays with dimension 0 or
1.</li>
