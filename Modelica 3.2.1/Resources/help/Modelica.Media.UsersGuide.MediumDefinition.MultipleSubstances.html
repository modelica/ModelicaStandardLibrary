<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>When writing the model of a multiple-substance medium, a
fundamental issue concerns how to consider the mass fractions of
the fluid. If there are nS substances, there are also nS mass
fractions; however, one of them is redundant, as sum(X) = 1.
Therefore there are basically two options, concerning the number of
independent mass fractions nXi:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Reduced-state models</i>: reducedX = <b>true</b> and nXi =
nS - 1. In this case, the number of independent mass fractions nXi
is the minimum possible. The full state vector X is provided by
equations declared in the base class
Interfaces.PartialMedium.BaseProperties: the first nXi elements are
equal to Xi, and the last one is 1 - sum(Xi).</li>
<li><i>Full-state models</i>: reducedX = <b>false</b> and nXi = nS.
In this case, Xi = X, i.e., all the elements of the composition
vector are considered as independent variables, and the constraint
sum(X) = 1 is never written explicitly. Although this kind of model
is heavier, as it provides one extra state variable, it can be less
prone to numerical and/or symbolic problems, which can be caused by
that constraint.</li>
<li><i>Fixed-composition models</i>: fixedX = <b>true</b> and nXi =
0. In this case X = reference_X, i.e., all the elements of the
composition vector are fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The medium implementer can declare the value reducedX as
<b>final</b>. In this way only one implementation must be given.
For instance, Modelica.Media.IdealGases models declare <b>final</b>
reducedX = <b>false</b>, so that the implementation can always
assume nXi = nX. The same is true for Air.MoistAir, which declares
<b>final</b> reducedX = <b>true</b>, and always assumes nXi = nX -
1 = 1.</p>
<p>It is also possible to leave reducedX modifiable. In this case,
the BaseProperties model and all additional functions should check
for the actual value of reducedX, and provide the corresponding
implementation.</p>
<p>If fixedX is left modifiable, then the implementation should
also handle the case fixedX = true properly.</p>
<p>Fluid connectors should always use composition vectors of size
Xi, such as in the Modelica_Fluid library:</p>
<pre>
<b>connector</b> FluidPort
  <b>replaceable package</b> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
  Medium.AbsolutePressure      p;
  <b>flow</b> Medium.MassFlowRate     m_flow;

  Medium.SpecificEnthalpy      h;
  <b>flow</b> Medium.EnthalpyFlowRate H_flow;

  Medium.MassFraction          Xi    [Medium.nXi];
  <b>flow</b> Medium.MassFlowRate     mX_flow[Medium.nXi];
<b>end</b> FluidPort;
</pre>

model</a> and <a href="Modelica.Media.Air.MoistAir.html">MoistAir model</a>.</p>
