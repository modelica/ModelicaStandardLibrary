<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>A medium model of Modelica.Media is essentially a <b>package</b>
that contains the following definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition of <b>constants</b>, such as the medium name.</li>
<li>A <b>model</b> in the package that contains the 3 basic
thermodynamic equations that relate the 5+nXi primary medium
variables.</li>
<li><b>Optional functions</b> to compute medium properties that are
only needed in certain circumstances, such as dynamic viscosity.
These optional functions need not be provided by every medium
model.</li>
<li><b>Type</b> definitions, which are adapted to the particular
medium. For example, a type <b>Temperature</b> is defined where the
attributes <b>min</b> and <b>max</b> define the validity region of
the medium, and a suitable default start value is given. In a
device model, it is advisable to use these type definitions, e.g.,
for parameters, in order that medium limits are checked as early as
possible, and that iteration variables of non-linear systems of
equations get reasonable start values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, although we use the term <b>medium model</b>, it is
actually a Modelica <b>package</b> that contains all the constants
and definitions required for a complete <b>medium model</b>. The
basic interface to a medium is defined by
Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium that has the following
structure:</p>

</pre>
<p>We will discuss all parts of this package in the following
paragraphs. An actual medium model should extend from PartialMedium
and has to provide implementations of the various parts.</p>
<p>Some of the constants at the beginning of the package do not
have a value yet (this is valid in Modelica), but a value has to be
provided when extending from package PartialMedium. A given value
can be modified until the model is translated or the <b>final</b>
prefix is set. The reason to use constants instead of parameters in
the model BaseProperties is that some of these constants are used
in a context where parameters are not allowed. For example, in
connector definitions the number of independent mass fractions nXi
is used as dimension of a vector Xi. When defining the connector,
only <i>constants</i> in packages can be accessed, but not
<i>parameters</i> in a model, because a connector cannot contain an
instance of BaseProperties.</p>
<p>The record BasePropertiesRecord contains the variables primarily
used in balance equations. Three equations for these variables have
to be provided by every medium in model BaseProperties, plus two
equations for the gas constant and the molar mass.</p>
<p>Optional medium properties are defined by functions, such as the
function dynamicViscosity (see code Section above) to compute the
dynamic viscosity. The argument of those functions is the
ThermodynamicState record, defined in BaseProperties, which
contains the minimum number of thermodynamic variables needed as an
input to compute all the optional properties. This construction
simplifies the usage considerably as demonstrated in the following
code fragment:</p>
<pre>
  <b>replaceable package</b> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
  Medium.BaseProperties   medium;
  Medium.DynamicViscosity eta;
  ...
  U   = m*medium.u; //Internal energy
  eta = Medium.dynamicViscosity(medium.state);
</pre>
<p>Medium is the medium package that satisfies the requirements of
a PartialMedium (when using the model above, a value for Medium has
to be provided by a redeclaration). The medium component is an
instance of the model Medium.BaseProperties and contains the core
medium equations. Variables in this model can be accessed just by
dot-notation, such as medium.u or medium.T. If an optional medium
variable has to be computed, the corresponding function from the
actual Medium package is called, such as Medium.dynamicViscosity.
The medium.state vector can be given as input argument to this
function, and its fields are kept consistent to those of
BaseProperties by suitable equations, contained in BaseProperties
itself (see above).</p>
<p>If a medium model does not provide implementations of all
optional functions and one of these functions is called in a model,
an error occurs during translation since the optional functions
which have not been redeclared have the <i>partial</i> attribute.
For example, if function dynamicViscosity is not provided in the
medium model when it is used, only simple pressure drop loss models
without a reference to the viscosity can be used and not the
sophisticated ones.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the PartialMedium package type declarations are
present, that are used in all other parts of the PartialMedium
package and that should be used in all models and connectors where
a medium model is accessed. The reason is that minimum, maximum,
nominal, and start values are defined and these values can be
adapted to the particular medium at hand. For example, the nominal
value of AbsolutePressure is 10<sup>5</sup> Pa. If a simple model
of water steam is used that is only valid above 100 °C, then the
minimum value in the Temperature type should be set to this value.
The minimum and maximum values are also important for parameters in
order to get an early message if data outside of the validity
region is given. The nominal attribute is important as a scaling
value if the variable is used as a state in a differential equation
or as an iteration variable in a non-linear system of equations.
The start attribute can be very useful to provide a meaningful
default start or guess value if the variable is used, e.g., as
iteration variable in a non-linear system of equations. Note, that
all these attributes can be set specifically for a medium in the
following way:</p>
<pre>
<b>package</b> MyMedium
  <b>extends</b> Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium(
     ...
     Temperature(min=373));
<b>end</b> MyMedium;
</pre>
<p>The type PartialMedium.MassFlowRate is defined as</p>
<pre>
<b>type</b> MassFlowRate = Modelica.SIunits.MassFlowRate
     (quantity = "MassFlowRate." + mediumName);
</pre>
<p>Note that the constant mediumName, that has to be defined in
every medium model, is used in the quantity attribute. For example,
if mediumName = SimpleLiquidWater, then the quantity attribute has
the value MassFlowRate.SimpleLiquidWater. This type should be used
in a connector definition of a fluid library:</p>
<pre>
<b>connector</b> FluidPort
  <b>replaceable package</b> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
  <b>flow</b> Medium.MassFlowRate m_flow;
  ...
<b>end</b> FluidPort;
</pre>
<p>In the model where this connector is used, the actual Medium has
to be defined. Connectors can only be connected together, if the
corresponding attributes are either not defined or have identical
values. Since mediumName is part of the quantity attribute of
MassFlowRate, it is not possible to connect connectors with
different media models together. In Dymola this is already checked
when models are connected together in the diagram layer of the
graphical user interface.</p>
