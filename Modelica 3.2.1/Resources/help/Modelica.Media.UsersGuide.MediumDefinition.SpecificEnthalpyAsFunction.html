<p>If pressure p and specific enthalpy h are <b>not</b> used as
independent medium variables, the specific enthalpy should be
computed by a Modelica function that has as input arguments only
the independent medium variables. It should <b>not</b> be computed
by an equation. For example, if p and T are used as independent
medium variables, a function h_pT(p,T) should be defined that is
called to compute h:</p>
<pre>
    h = h_pT(p,T);
</pre>
<p>The reason for this rule requires a longer explanation. In
short, if h is not a computed by a Modelica function and this
function is non-linear in the independent medium variables, then
non-linear systems of equations will occur at every connection
point, if the FluidPort connectors from the Modelica_Fluid library
are used (these are the same as in
Modelica.Media.Examples.Tests.Components.FluidPort). Only, if the
above rule is fulfilled, a tool is able to remove these non-linear
system of equations in most cases.</p>
<p>The basic idea of the FluidPort connector is that 2 or more
components can be connected together at a point and that
automatically the mass and energy balance is fulfilled in the
connection point, i.e., the ideal mixing equations are generated.
Note, the momentum balance is only correct for straight line
connections. If "ideal mixing" is not sufficient, a special
component to define the mixing equations must be introduced.</p>
<p>The mass and momentum balance equations in a component are
derived from the partial differential equations along the flow
direction of a pipe:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Media/UsersGuide/BalanceEquations1.png" /></p>
<p>Note, F<sub>F</sub> is the fanning friction factor. The energy
balance can be given in different forms. Usually, it is given
as:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Media/UsersGuide/EnergyBalance1.png" /></p>
<p>This form describes the change of the internal energy, kinetic
energy and potential energy of a volume as function of the in and
out flowing fluid. Multiplying the momentum balance with the flow
velocity v and subtracting it from the energy balance above,
results in the following alternative form of the energy
balance:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Media/UsersGuide/EnergyBalance2.png" /></p>
<p>This form has the advantage that the kinetic and potential
energy is no longer part of the energy balance and therefore the
energy balance is substantially simpler (e.g., additional
non-linear systems of equations occur in the first form since the
velocity is present in the energy balance; in the second form this
is not the case and it is still valid also for high speeds).</p>
<p>Assume now that the second form of the energy balance above is
used in all components and that the following FluidPort connector
is used in all components:</p>
<pre>
<b>connector</b> FluidPort
  <b>replaceable package</b> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
  Medium.AbsolutePressure      p;
  <b>flow</b> Medium.MassFlowRate     m_flow;

  Medium.SpecificEnthalpy      h;
  <b>flow</b> Medium.EnthalpyFlowRate H_flow;

  Medium.MassFraction          Xi    [Medium.nXi];
  <b>flow</b> Medium.MassFlowRate     mX_flow[Medium.nXi];
<b>end</b> FluidPort;
</pre>
<p>As an example, assume that 3 components are connected together
and that the medium is a single substance fluid. This will result
in the following connection equations:</p>
<pre>
    p1=p2=p3;
    h1=h2=h3;
    0 = m_flow1 + m_flow2 + m_flow3;
    0 = H_flow1 + H_flow2 + H_flow3;
</pre>
<p>These are the mass balance and the energy balance (form 2) of an
infinitesimal volume in the connection point under the assumption
that no mass or energy is stored in this volume. In other words,
the connection equations are the equations that describe ideal
mixing. Under the assumption that the velocity vectors of the 3
flows are identical (especially, they are parallel), also the
momentum balance is fulfilled:</p>
<pre>
   0 = m_flow1*v1 + m_flow2*v2 + m_flow3*v3;
     = v*(m_flow1 + m_flow2 + m_flow3);
     = 0;
</pre>
<p>With the above connector it is therefore possible to connect
components together in a nearly arbitrary fashion, because every
connection fulfills automatically the balance equations. This
approach has, however, one drawback: If two components are
connected together, then the medium variables on both sides of the
connector are identical. However, due to the connector, only the
two equations</p>
<pre>
   p1 = p2;
   h1 = h2;
</pre>
<p>are present. Assume, that p,T are the independent medium
variables and that the medium properties are computed at one side
of the connections. This means, the following equations are
basically present:</p>
<pre>
    h1 = h(p1,T1);
    h2 = h(p2,T2);
    p1 = p2;
    h1 = h2;
</pre>
<p>These equations can be solved in the following way:</p>
<pre>
    h1 := h(p1,T1)
    p2 := p1;
    h2 := h1;
    0  := h2 - h(p2,T2);   // non-linear system of equations for T2
</pre>
<p>This means that T2 is computed by solving a non-linear system of
equations. If h1 and h2 are provided as Modelica functions, a
Modelica translator, such as Dymola, can replace this non-linear
system of equations by the equation:</p>
<pre>
   T2 := T1;
</pre>
<p>because after alias substitution there are two function
calls</p>
<pre>
    h1 := h(p1,T1);
    h1 := h(p1,T2);
</pre>
<p>Since the left hand side of the function call and the first
argument are the same, the second arguments T1 and T2 must also be
identical and therefore T2 := T1. This type of analysis seems to be
only possible, if the specific enthalpy is defined as a function of
the independent medium variables.</p>
