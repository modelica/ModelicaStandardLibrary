<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Only a few components of the Rotational library use the der(..)
operator and are therefore candidates to have states. Most
important, component <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Components.Inertia.html">Inertia</a>
defines the absolute rotation angle and the absolute angular
velocity of this component as candidate for states. In the
"Advanced" menu the built-in StateSelect enumeration can be set to
define the priority to use these variables as states. Without
further action, in most cases a tool will select these variables as
states.</p>
<p>For positioning drive trains where the goal is to position a
load (e.g. the drive train of a robot, or of an elevator), the
absolute angles of the components are bounded, and the issue
discussed below is not present.</p>
<p>For drive trains where the goal is to control the velocity of a
load (e.g. the drive train of a vehicle or the crank angle of an
engine), the absolute angles of the components are quickly
increasing during operation. This is critical, because then the
step size control of time integrators might then no longer work
appropriately:</p>
<p>Integrators with step size control adjust their time step size
automatically to meet user defined error bounds ("tolerances").
Typically the local error estimate EST_i is compared with a mixed
bound for absolute and relative errors.</p>
<pre>
   EST_i ≤ abstol_i + reltol_i*|x_i|
</pre>
<p>Here, abstol_i and reltol_i denote the bounds for the absolute
and relative error of state variable x_i, respectively. This mixed
error bound is used since it is more robust than a pure relative
error based error bound if the nominal value x_i is (very) close to
0. In a Modelica simulation model, typically the same relative
tolerance reltol is used for all states and the absolute tolerances
are computed using the relative tolerance and the nominal values of
the states:</p>
<pre>
   reltol_i = reltol
   abstol_i = reltol*x_i(nominal)*0.01
</pre>
<p>This error control fails if the state variable x_i grows without
bounds (such as for a drive train or the crank angle of a vehicle),
since then the allowed error also grows without bounds. The effect
is that the error control on this variable is practically switched
off. The correct way to handle this would be to set reltol_i = 0 on
such a state variable and only use an absolute tolerance for the
step size control.</p>
<p>Currently, in Modelica there is no possibility to provide this
information. In order to reduce this effect, it is advisable to not
use absolute angles, but relative angles as states. A user can
define relative variables as states explicitly with component
<a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Components.RelativeStates.html">
RelativeStates</a>. Furthermore, all compliant components, such as
<a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Components.SpringDamper.html">SpringDamper</a>
are defining the relative angle and the relative angular velocity
as preferred states. Therefore, a tool will select in most cases
relative angles as states.</p>
<p>The relative angles of compliant components are usually small.
For example, the deformation of a typical elastic component is in
the order of 1e-4 rad. Without further action, the error control
would not work properly on variables that are so small (so often
switching the error control off). The remedy is to define
explicitly a nominal value on the relative angle. This definition
is provided in the "Advanced" menu of the compliant components with
parameter "phi_nominal". The default value is 1e-4 rad, to be in
the order of a compliant deformation of a drive. For some
components, like a <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Components.Clutch.html">Clutch</a>
this might be too small and a value of phi_nominal=1 might be more
appropriate (a value of phi_nominal = 1e-4 does not hurt, but just
makes the error control unnecessarily stringent).</p>
