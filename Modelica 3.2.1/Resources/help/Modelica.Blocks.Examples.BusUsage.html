<p><b>Signal bus concept</b></p>
<p>In technical systems, such as vehicles, robots or satellites,
many signals are exchanged between components. In a simulation
system, these signals are usually modelled by signal connections of
input/output blocks. Unfortunately, the signal connection structure
may become very complicated, especially for hierarchical
models.</p>
<p>The same is also true for real technical systems. To reduce
complexity and get higher flexibility, many technical systems use
data buses to exchange data between components. For the same
reasons, it is often better to use a "signal bus" concept also in a
Modelica model. This is demonstrated at hand of this model
(Modelica.Blocks.Examples.BusUsage):</p>
<img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Blocks/BusUsage.png" alt="BusUsage.png" />
<ul>
<li>Connector instance "controlBus" is a hierarchical connector
that is used to exchange signals between different components. It
is defined as "expandable connector" in order that <b>no</b>
central definition of the connector is needed but is automatically
constructed by the signals connected to it (see also Modelica
specification 2.2.1).</li>
<li>Input/output signals can be directly connected to the
"controlBus".</li>
<li>A component, such as "part", can be directly connected to the
"controlBus", provided it has also a bus connector, or the "part"
connector is a sub-connector contained in the "controlBus".</li>
</ul>
<p>The control and sub-control bus icons are provided within
Modelica.Icons. In <a href="Modelica.Blocks.Examples.BusUsage_Utilities.Interfaces.html">
Modelica.Blocks.Examples.BusUsage_Utilities.Interfaces</a> the
buses for this example are defined. Both the "ControlBus" and the
"SubControlBus" are <b>expandable</b> connectors that do not define
any variable. For example, <a href="Modelica.Blocks.Examples.BusUsage_Utilities.Interfaces.ControlBus.html#text">
Interfaces.ControlBus</a> is defined as:</p>
<pre>
  <b>expandable connector</b> ControlBus
      <b>extends</b> Modelica.Icons.ControlBus;
      <b>annotation</b> ();
  <b>end</b> ControlBus;
</pre>
<p>Note, the "annotation" in the connector is important since the
color and thickness of a connector line are taken from the first
line element in the icon annotation of a connector class. Above, a
small rectangle in the color of the bus is defined (and therefore
this rectangle is not visible). As a result, when connecting from
an instance of this connector to another connector instance, the
connecting line has the color of the "ControlBus" with double width
(due to "thickness=0.5").</p>
<p>An <b>expandable</b> connector is a connector where the content
of the connector is constructed by the variables connected to
instances of this connector. For example, if "sine.y" is connected
to the "controlBus", the following menu pops-up in Dymola:</p>
<img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Blocks/BusUsage2.png" alt="BusUsage2.png" />
<p>The "Add variable/New name" field allows the user to define the
name of the signal on the "controlBus". When typing "realSignal1"
as "New name", a connection of the form:</p>
<pre>
     <b>connect</b>(sine.y, controlBus.realSignal1)
</pre>
<p>is generated and the "controlBus" contains the new signal
"realSignal1". Modelica tools may give more support in order to
list potential signals for a connection. For example, in Dymola all
variables are listed in the menu that are contained in connectors
which are derived by inheritance from "controlBus". Therefore, in
<a href="Modelica.Blocks.Examples.BusUsage_Utilities.Interfaces.html">
BusUsage_Utilities.Interfaces</a> the expected implementation of
the "ControlBus" and of the "SubControlBus" are given. For example
"Internal.ControlBus" is defined as:</p>
<pre>
  <b>expandable connector</b> StandardControlBus
    <b>extends</b> BusUsage_Utilities.Interfaces.ControlBus;

    <b>import</b> SI = Modelica.SIunits;
    SI.AngularVelocity    realSignal1   "First Real signal";
    SI.Velocity           realSignal2   "Second Real signal";
    Integer               integerSignal "Integer signal";
    Boolean               booleanSignal "Boolean signal";
    StandardSubControlBus subControlBus "Combined signal";
  <b>end</b> StandardControlBus;
</pre>
<p>Consequently, when connecting now from "sine.y" to "controlBus",
the menu looks differently:</p>
<img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Blocks/BusUsage3.png" alt="BusUsage3.png" />
<p>Note, even if the signals from "Internal.StandardControlBus" are
listed, these are just potential signals. The user might still add
different signal names.</p>
