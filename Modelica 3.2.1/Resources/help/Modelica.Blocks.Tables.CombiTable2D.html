<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p><b>Linear interpolation</b> in <b>two</b> dimensions of a
<b>table</b>. The grid points and function values are stored in a
matrix "table[i,j]", where:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first column "table[2:,1]" contains the u[1] grid
points,</li>
<li>the first row "table[1,2:]" contains the u[2] grid points,</li>
<li>the other rows and columns contain the data to be
interpolated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
           |       |       |       |
           |  1.0  |  2.0  |  3.0  |  // u2
       ----*-------*-------*-------*
       1.0 |  1.0  |  3.0  |  5.0  |
       ----*-------*-------*-------*
       2.0 |  2.0  |  4.0  |  6.0  |
       ----*-------*-------*-------*
     // u1
   is defined as
      table = [0.0,   1.0,   2.0,   3.0;
               1.0,   1.0,   3.0,   5.0;
               2.0,   2.0,   4.0,   6.0]
   If, e.g., the input u is [1.0;1.0], the output y is 1.0,
       e.g., the input u is [2.0;1.5], the output y is 3.0.
</pre>
<ul>
<li>The interpolation is <b>efficient</b>, because a search for a
new interpolation starts at the interval used in the last
call.</li>
<li>If the table has only <b>one element</b>, the table value is
returned, independent of the value of the input signal.</li>
<li>If the input signal <b>u1</b> or <b>u2</b> is <b>outside</b> of
the defined <b>interval</b>, the corresponding value is also
determined by linear interpolation through the last or first two
points of the table.</li>
<li>The grid values (first column and first row) have to be
strictly increasing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The table matrix can be defined in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explicitly supplied as <b>parameter matrix</b> "table", and the
other parameters have the following values:
<pre>
   tableName is "NoName" or has only blanks,
   fileName  is "NoName" or has only blanks.
</pre></li>
<li><b>Read</b> from a <b>file</b> "fileName" where the matrix is
stored as "tableName". Both ASCII and MAT-file format is possible.
(The ASCII format is described below). The MAT-file format comes in
four different versions: v4, v6, v7 and v7.3. The library supports
at least v4, v6 and v7 whereas v7.3 is optional. It is most
convenient to generate the MAT-file from FreeMat or MATLAB® by
command
<pre>
   save tables.mat tab1 tab2 tab3
</pre>
or Scilab by command
<pre>
   savematfile tables.mat tab1 tab2 tab3
</pre>
when the three tables tab1, tab2, tab3 should be used from the
model.<br />
Note, a fileName can be defined as URI by using the helper function
<a href="Modelica.Utilities.Files.loadResource.html">loadResource</a>.</li>
<li>Statically stored in function "usertab" in file "usertab.c".
The matrix is identified by "tableName". Parameter fileName =
"NoName" or has only blanks. Row-wise storage is always to be
preferred as otherwise the table is reallocated and transposed. See
the <a href="Modelica.Blocks.Tables.html">Tables</a> package
documentation for more details.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the constant "NO_FILE_SYSTEM" is defined, all file I/O
related parts of the source code are removed by the C-preprocessor,
such that no access to files takes place.</p>
<p>If tables are read from an ASCII-file, the file needs to have
the following structure ("-----" is not part of the file
content):</p>
<pre>
-----------------------------------------------------
#1
double table2D_1(3,4)   # comment line
0.0  1.0  2.0  3.0  # u[2] grid points
1.0  1.0  3.0  5.0
2.0  2.0  4.0  6.0

double table2D_2(4,4)   # comment line
0.0  1.0  2.0  3.0  # u[2] grid points
1.0  1.0  3.0  5.0
2.0  2.0  4.0  6.0
3.0  3.0  5.0  7.0
-----------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>Note, that the first two characters in the file need to be "#1"
(a line comment defining the version number of the file format).
Afterwards, the corresponding matrix has to be declared with type
(= "double" or "float"), name and actual dimensions. Finally, in
successive rows of the file, the elements of the matrix have to be
given. The elements have to be provided as a sequence of numbers in
row-wise order (therefore a matrix row can span several lines in
the file and need not start at the beginning of a line). Numbers
have to be given according to C syntax (such as 2.3, -2, +2.e4).
Number separators are spaces, tab ( ), comma (,), or semicolon (;).
Several matrices may be defined one after another. Line comments
start with the hash symbol (#) and can appear everywhere. Other
characters, like trailing non comments, are not allowed in the
file. The matrix elements are interpreted in exactly the same way
as if the matrix is given as a parameter. For example, the first
column "table2D_1[2:,1]" contains the u[1] grid points, and the
first row "table2D_1[1,2:]" contains the u[2] grid points.</p>
