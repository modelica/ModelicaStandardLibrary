<p>Note, there is a much improved version of this library called
"Modelica_StateGraph2". If this library is not yet distributed with
your Modelica tool, you can download it from <a href="https://www.modelica.org/libraries/Modelica_StateGraph2">https://www.modelica.org/libraries/Modelica_StateGraph2</a>.
In the <a href="Modelica.StateGraph.UsersGuide.ComparisonWithStateGraph2.html">
Users Guide</a> a detailed comparison is given. It is highly
recommended to use Modelica_StateGraph2 instead of
Modelica.StateGraph.</p>
<p>Library <b>StateGraph</b> is a <b>free</b> Modelica package
providing components to model <b>discrete event</b> and
<b>reactive</b> systems in a convenient way. It is based on the
JGrafchart method and takes advantage of Modelica features for the
"action" language. JGrafchart is a further development of Grafcet
to include elements of StateCharts that are not present in
Grafcet/Sequential Function Charts. Therefore, the StateGraph
library has a similar modeling power as StateCharts but avoids some
deficiencies of StateCharts.</p>
<p>For an introduction, have especially a look at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Modelica.StateGraph.UsersGuide.html">StateGraph.UsersGuide</a>
discusses the most important aspects how to use this library.</li>
<li><a href="Modelica.StateGraph.Examples.html">StateGraph.Examples</a>
contains examples that demonstrate the usage of this library.</li>
</ul>
<p>A typical model generated with this library is shown in the next
figure where on the left hand side a two-tank system with a tank
controller and on the right hand side the top-level part of the
tank controller as a StateGraph is shown:</p>

</p>
<p>The unique feature of the StateGraph library with respect to
JGrafcharts, Grafcet, Sequential Function Charts, and StateCharts,
is Modelica's "single assignment rule" that requires that every
variable is defined by exactly one equation. This leads to a
different "action" definition as in these formalisms. The advantage
is that the translator can either determine a useful evaluation
sequence by equation sorting or reports an error if this is not
possible, e.g., because a model would lead to a non-determinism or
to a dead-lock. As a side effect, this leads also to simpler and
more easier to understand models and global variables are no longer
needed (whereas in JGrafcharts, Grafcet, Sequential Function Charts
and StateCharts global variables are nearly always needed).</p>
