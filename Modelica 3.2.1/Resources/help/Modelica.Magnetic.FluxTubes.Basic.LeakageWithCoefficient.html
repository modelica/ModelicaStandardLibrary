<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Differently from the flux tube elements of package <a href="Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes.Shapes.Leakage.html">Shapes.Leakage</a>
that are calculated from their geometry, this leakage reluctance is
calculated with reference to the total reluctance of a useful flux
path. Please refer to the <b>Parameters</b> section for an
illustration of the resulting magnetic network. Exploiting
<i>Kirchhoff</i>'s generalized current law, the leakage reluctance
is calculated by means of a coupling coefficient c_usefulFlux.</p>
<h4>Attention:</h4>
<p>This element must <b>not</b> be used <b>for dynamic simulation
of</b> electro-magneto-mechanical <b>actuators</b>, where the shape
of at least one flux tube element with reluctance force generation
in the useful flux path changes with armature motion (e.g., air
gap). This change results in a non-zero derivative dG_m/dx of those
elements permeance G_m with respect to armature position x, which
in turn will lead to a non-zero derivative of the leakage permeance
with respect to armature position. This would generate a reluctance
force in the leakage element that is not accounted for properly.
<a href="Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes.Shapes.Force.LeakageAroundPoles.html">
Shapes.Force.LeakageAroundPoles</a> provides a simple leakage
reluctance with force generation.</p>
