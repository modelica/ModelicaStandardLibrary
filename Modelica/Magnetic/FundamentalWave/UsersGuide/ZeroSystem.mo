The polyphase winding relates the currents to the magnetic potential phasor of the fundamental wave and the derivative of the magnetic flux phasor of the fundamental wave to the voltages, 
taking the orientation of the phases into account. However, for the number of phases <code>m &gt; 2</code> the zero sequence system has to be treated with care. 
This happens in the zero inductance:
</p>
<p>
<code>i0 = sum(i)/m;</code><br>
<code>v0 = Lzero*der(i0);</code><br>
<code>v0</code> is included in all phases with the same phase shift.
</p>
<p>
This is equivalent to the zero inductor used in the 
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Electrical.Machines.Interfaces.PartialBasicInductionMachine\">machine model of <code>Modelica.Electrical.Machines</code></a> after applying 
space phasor transformation.
</p>
<p>
In some cases it could be desired to suppress the calculation of the zero system. This can be done in both machine models (<code>Modelica.Magnetic.FundamentalWave</code> and 
<code>Modelica.Electrical.Machines</code>) by setting the Boolean parameter <code>useZeroSystem = false</code> (which by default is <code>true</code>). 
This ensures that the zero current is equal to zero and there is no need to calculate it:<br>
<code>i0 = 0;</code>
