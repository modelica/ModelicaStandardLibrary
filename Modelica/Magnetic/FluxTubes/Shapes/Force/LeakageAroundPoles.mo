<p>
Leakage flux around a prismatic or cylindric air gap between to poles can be described with this model. Due to its constant radius of the leakage field r, the model is rather simple. Whereas in reality the leakage radius is approximately constant for air gap lengths l greater than this radius, it decreases with air gap lengths less than the leakage radius. This decrease for small air gaps is neglected here, since the influence of the leakage flux tube compared to that of the enclosed main air gap (connected in parallel) decreases for decreasing air gap length l.
