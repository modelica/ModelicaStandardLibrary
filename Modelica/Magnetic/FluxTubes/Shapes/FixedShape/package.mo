Please have a look at <a href=\"modelica:/Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes.UsersGuide.ReluctanceForceCalculation\">UsersGuide.ReluctanceForceCalculation</a> for an explanation of the different flux tube categories and resulting sub-packages.
</p>

<p>
Due to the restrictions on reluctance force calculation outlined there, flux tube elements with a possibly non-linear material characteristic mu_r(B) must have a fixed shape during simulation of converter motion. Hence, the dimensions of these flux tubes are defined as parameters in the model components that extend the base class <a href=\"modelica:/Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes.BaseClasses.FixedShape\">BaseClasses.FixedShape</a>.</p>

<p>
For initial design of magnetic circuits, the relative permeability of possibly non-linear flux tube elements can easily be set to a constant value mu_rConst (non-linearPermeability set to false). In some cases, this can simplify the rough geometric design of a device's magnetic circuit. Once an initial geometry is found, the magnetic subsystem can be simulated and fine-tuned with more realistic non-linear characteristics of ferromagnetic materials. Doing so requires setting of the parameter non-linearPermeability to true and selection of one of the soft magnetic materials of <a href=\"modelica:/Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes.Material.SoftMagnetic\">Material.SoftMagnetic</a>.
