<p>
This partial model provides a conditional heat port for dissipating losses.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If <strong>useHeatPort</strong> is set to <strong>false</strong> (default), no heat port is available, and the thermal loss power is dissipated internally.</li>
<li>If <strong>useHeatPort</strong> is set to <strong>true</strong>, the heat port is available and must be connected from the outside.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If this model is used, the loss power has to be provided by an equation in the model which inherits from the PartialElementaryConditionalHeatPortWithoutT model
(<strong>lossPower = ...</strong>).
</p>

<p>
Note, this partial model is used in cases, where heatPort.T (that is the device temperature) is not utilized in the model. If this is desired, inherit instead from partial model
<a href=\"modelica:/Modelica.Thermal.HeatTransfer.Interfaces.PartialElementaryConditionalHeatPort\">PartialElementaryConditionalHeatPort</a>.
