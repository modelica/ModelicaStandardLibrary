according to article 2d), since this will in the end usually qualify
as Derivative Work. The reasoning is the following: A type class or
part of another class (e.g., an equation, a declaration, part of a
class description) cannot be utilized &ldquo;by its own&rdquo;. In
order to make this &ldquo;usable&rdquo;, you have to add additional
code in order that the class can be utilized. This is therefore
usually Derivative Work and Derivative Work can be provided under a
different license. Note, this only holds, if the additional code
introduced is sufficient to qualify for Derivative Work. Merely, just
copying a class and changing, say, one character in the documentation
of this class would be no Derivative Work and therefore the copied
code would have to stay under Modelica License 2.</P>

If the modification can be seen as a &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo;,
you can place it under your commercial/proprietary license. If the
modification does not qualify as &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo; (e.g.,
bug fixes, vendor specific annotations), it must remain under

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0pt; font-weight: medium">Yes.
Note, if the encryption does not allow &ldquo;copying&rdquo; of

the Modelica source code of this package to your customer, if he/she

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0pt; font-weight: medium">Yes,
according to article 2d), since this is seen as Derivative Work. The
reasoning is the following: An executable allows the simulation of a
concrete model, whereas models from a Modelica package (without
pre-processing, translation, tool run-time library) are not able to
be simulated without tool support. By the processing of the tool and
by its run-time libraries, significant new functionality is added (a
model can be simulated whereas previously it could not be simulated)
and functionality available in the package is removed (e.g., to build
up a new model by dragging components of the package is no longer
possible with the executable).</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0pt"><B>Is my modification to
a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) a Derivative Work?</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0pt; font-weight: medium">It
is not possible to give a general answer to it. To be regarded as &quot;an
original work of authorship&quot;, a derivative work must be
different enough from the original or must contain a substantial
amount of new material. Making minor changes or additions of little
substance to a preexisting work will not qualify the work as a new
version for such purposes.
