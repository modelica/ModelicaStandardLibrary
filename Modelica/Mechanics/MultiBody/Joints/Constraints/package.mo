  annotation (Documentation(info="<html>
<p>
This package contains <strong>constraint components</strong>, that is, idealized, massless elements that
constrain the motion between frames by means of kinematic constraints. The constraint
elements are especially aimed to be used for multibody models which contain <strong>kinematic loops</strong>.
Usually, kinematic loops are automatically handled. However, the performance might be improved
by either solving certain kinds of loops analytically with the help of the components of
subpackage  <a href=\"Modelica://Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Joints.Assemblies\">Assemblies</a>, or
by providing numerically better loop constraint formulations with the help of the components
of this subpackage.
