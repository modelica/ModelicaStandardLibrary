<p>
This package demonstrates the usage of elements of the Mechanics.Rotational library
by taking into account all 3-dim. effects. The reason for this type of modeling is
to speedup the simulation drastically. This is possible if moving bodies have
rotational symmetry. A typical application area are drive trains, driving joints of
a multi-body system.
