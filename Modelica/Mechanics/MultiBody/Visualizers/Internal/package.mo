<p>
This package contains components to construct 3-dim. fonts
with \"cylinder\" elements for the animation window.
This is a makeshift as long as the support of 3-dim. fonts is not specified in the
Modelica language. The components are used to construct the \"x\", \"y\",
\"z\" labels of coordinates systems in the animation.
