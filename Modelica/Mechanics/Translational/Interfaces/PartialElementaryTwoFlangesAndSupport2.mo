<p>
This is a 1-dim. translational component with two flanges and an additional support.
It is used e.g., to build up elementary ideal gear components. The component
contains the force balance, i.e., the sum of the forces of the connectors
is zero (therefore, components that are based on PartialGear cannot have
a mass). The support connector needs to be connected
to avoid the unphysical behavior that the
support force is required to be zero (= the default value, if the
connector is not connected).
