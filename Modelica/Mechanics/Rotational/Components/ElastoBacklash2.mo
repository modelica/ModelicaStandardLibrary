    Documentation(info="<html>
<p>
This element consists of a <strong>backlash</strong> element <strong>connected in series</strong>
to a <strong>spring</strong> and <strong>damper</strong> element which are <strong>connected in parallel</strong>.
The spring constant shall be non-zero, otherwise the component cannot be used.
</p>

<p>
In combination with components IdealGear, the ElastoBacklash2 model
can be used to model a gear box with backlash, elasticity and damping.
</p>

<p>
During initialization, the backlash characteristic is replaced by a continuous
approximation in the backlash region, in order to reduce problems during
initialization, especially for inverse models.
</p>

<p>
If the backlash b is smaller as 1e-10 rad (especially, if b=0),
then the backlash is ignored and the component reduces to a spring/damper
element in parallel.
</p>

<p>
In the backlash region (-b/2 &le; flange_b.phi - flange_a.phi - phi_rel0 &le; b/2) no torque
is exerted (flange_b.tau = 0). Outside of this region, contact is present and
the contact torque is basically computed with a linear
spring/damper characteristic:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
desiredContactTorque = c*phi_contact + d*<strong>der</strong>(phi_contact)

         phi_contact = phi_rel - phi_rel0 - b/2 <strong>if</strong> phi_rel - phi_rel0 &gt;  b/2
                     = phi_rel - phi_rel0 + b/2 <strong>if</strong> phi_rel - phi_rel0 &lt; -b/2

         phi_rel     = flange_b.phi - flange_a.phi;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This torque characteristic leads to the following difficulty:
</p>

<ul>
<li> If the damper torque becomes larger as the spring torque and with opposite sign,
     the contact torque would be \"pulling/sticking\" which is unphysical, since during
     contact only pushing torques can occur.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the literature this issue seems to be not discussed. For this reason, the most simple
approach is used in the ElastoBacklash2 model, by slightly changing
the linear spring/damper characteristic to:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
// Torque characteristic when phi_rel > phi_rel0
<strong>if</strong> phi_rel - phi_rel0 &lt; b/2 <strong>then</strong>
   tau_c = 0;          // spring torque
   tau_d = 0;          // damper torque
   flange_b.tau = 0;
<strong>else</strong>
   tau_c = c*(phi_rel - phi_rel0);    // spring torque
   tau_d = d*<strong>der</strong>(phi_rel);            // damper torque
   flange_b.tau = <strong>if</strong> tau_c + tau_d &le; 0 <strong>then</strong> 0 <strong>else</strong> tau_c + tau_d;
<strong>end if</strong>;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Note, when sticking would occur (tau_c + tau_d &le; 0), then the contact torque
is explicitly set to zero.
</p>

<p>
This model of backlash is slightly different to the
<a href=\"modelica:/Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Components.ElastoBacklash\">ElastoBacklash</a>
component:
</p>

<ul>
<li> An event occurs when contact occurs or when contact is released (contrary to the ElastoBacklash component).</li>
<li> When contact occurs, the torque changes discontinuously, due to the damping.
     The damping is larger as for the ElastoBacklash component (for the same damping coefficient),
    because the ElastoBacklash component has a heuristic to avoid the discontinuity of the torque when contact occurs.</li>
<li> For some models, the ElastoBacklash2 component leads to faster simulations
      (as compared when using the ElastBacklash component).</li>
</ul>
