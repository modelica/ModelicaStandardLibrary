<p>
This is a 1-dim. rotational component with a compliant connection of two
rotational 1-dim. flanges where inertial effects between the two
flanges are neglected. The basic assumption is that the cut-torques
of the two flanges sum-up to zero, i.e., they have the same absolute value
but opposite sign: flange_a.tau + flange_b.tau = 0. This base class
is used to built up force elements such as springs, dampers, friction.
</p>

<p>
The relative angle and the relative speed are defined as preferred states.
The reason is that for some drive trains, such as drive
trains in vehicles, the absolute angle is quickly increasing during operation.
Numerically, it is better to use relative angles between drive train components
because they remain in a limited size. For this reason, StateSelect.prefer
is set for the relative angle of this component.
</p>

<p>
In order to improve the numerics, a nominal value for the relative angle
can be provided via parameter <strong>phi_nominal</strong> in the Advanced menu.
The default is 1e-4 rad since relative angles are usually
in this order and the step size control of an integrator would be
practically switched off, if a default of 1 rad would be used.
This nominal value might also be computed from other values, such
as \"phi_nominal = tau_nominal / c\" for a rotational spring, if tau_nominal
and c are more meaningful for the user.
