<p>
The Modelica.Fluid library provides basic interfaces and
components to model 1-dimensional thermo-fluid flow in networks of pipes.
It is not the intention that this library covers all
application cases because the fluid flow area is too large and
because for special applications it is possible to implement
libraries with simpler component interfaces.
Instead, the goal is that the Modelica.Fluid library provides
a <strong>reasonable set of components</strong> and that it <strong>demonstrates</strong>
how to implement components of a fluid flow library in Modelica,
in particular to cope with difficult issues such as connector
design, reversing flow and initialization.
</p>
<p>
This library has the following main features:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The connectors Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort_a/_b are designed
     for one-dimensional flow of a <strong>single substance</strong>
     or of a <strong>mixture of substances</strong> with optional <strong>multiple phases</strong>.
     All media models from Modelica.Media can be utilized when
     connecting components. For one substance media, the additional arrays for
     multiple
     substance media have zero dimension and are therefore removed
     from the code during translation. The general connector definition
     therefore does not introduce an overhead for special cases.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> All the components of the Modelica.Fluid library are designed
     that they can be utilized for all media models from
     Modelica.Media if this is possible. For example, all media can
     be utilized for the Modelica.Fluid.Sensors/Sources components.
     For some components only special media are possible, since additional
     functionality is required. For example,
     Modelica.Fluid.Components.Evaporator requires a two phase medium
     (extending from Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialTwoPhaseMedium).
     <br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> In order to simplify the initialization in the components,
     there is the restriction that only media models are supported
     that have T, (p,T), (p,h), (T,X), (p,T,X) or (p,h,X) as
     independent variables. Other media models would be possible,
     e.g., with (T,d) as independent variables. However, this requires
     to rewrite the code for the component initialization.
     (Note, T is temperature, p is pressure, d is density,
     h is specific enthalpy, and X is a mass fraction vector).
     <br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> All components work for <strong>incompressible</strong> and <strong>compressible</strong> media.
     This is implemented by a small change in the initialization of a
     component, if the medium is incompressible. Otherwise, the equations
     of the components are not influenced by this property.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> All components allow fluid flow in both directions, i.e.,
     <strong>reversing flow</strong> is supported. However, it is possible to declare that
     the flow through a component only has the design direction, in order to
     obtain faster simulation code.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> Two or more components can be connected together. This means that
     the pressures of all connected ports are equal and the mass flow rates
     sum up to zero. Specific enthalpy, mass fractions and trace substances are
     mixed according to the mass flow rates.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> The <strong>momentum balance</strong> and the <strong>energy balance</strong> are only fulfilled exactly if
     <strong>two ports of equal diameter</strong> are connected. In all other cases, the balances
     are approximated, because kinetic and friction effect are neglected. An explicit fitting
     or junction should be used if these are important for the specific problem at hand.
     In all circuits where friction dominates, or components such as pumps determine the flow rate,
     kinetic pressure is typically irrelevant. You can consider the
     <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Fluid.Examples.Explanatory.MomentumBalanceFittings\">Modelica.Fluid.Examples.Explanatory.MomentumBalanceFittings</a> model (and its documentation)
     to see one case where the momentum balance essentially depends on kinetic pressure,
     so it is necessary to use explicit fittings in order to obtain correct results.
     <br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> Given the above-mentioned limitations, there is no restriction how components can be connected
     together. The resulting simulation performance however often strongly depends on the
     model structure and modeling assumptions made. In particular the direct connection of
     fluid volumes generally results in high-index DAEs for the pressures. The direct
     connection of flow models generally results in systems of implicit nonlinear algebraic
     equations.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<p>
In this section the design of the fluid connectors is
explained.
</p>
<p>
Fluid connectors represent the points in a device (e.g., the
flanges) through which a fluid can flow into or out of the component, carrying its
thermodynamic properties; these flanges are assumed to be fixed in space.
</p>
<p>
A major design goal is that components can be arbitrarily
connected and that the important balance equations are automatically
fulfilled when 2 or more components are connected together at
one point as shown in the next figure:
</p>

<div>
<img src=\"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Images/Fluid/UsersGuide/ComponentDefinition/MixingConnections.png\"
     alt=\"MixingConnections.png\">
</div>

<p>
In such a case the balance equations define <strong>ideal mixing</strong>,
i.e., the upstream discretization scheme of each component uses
values that result from ideal mixing in
an infinitely small time period. If more realistic modelling
is desired that takes into account mixing losses, an explicit
model has to be used in the connection point.
</p>
<h4>Single substance media</h4>
<p>
For a single substance medium, the connector definition in
Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort reduces to
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<strong>connector</strong> FluidPort
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
    \"Medium model of the fluid\";
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.MassFlowRate m_flow
    \"Mass flow rate from the connection point into the component\";
  Medium.AbsolutePressure p
    \"Thermodynamic pressure in the connection point\";
  <strong>stream</strong> Medium.SpecificEnthalpy h_outflow
    \"Specific thermodynamic enthalpy close to the connection point if m_flow &lt; 0\";
<strong>end</strong> FluidPort;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The first statement defines the Medium flowing through the connector.
In a medium, medium specific types such as \"Medium.AbsolutePressure\"
are defined that contain medium specific values for the min, max and
nominal attributes. Furthermore, Medium.MassFlowRate is defined as:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<strong>type</strong> MassFlowRate = SI.MassFlowRate(
  quantity = \"MassFlowRate.\" + mediumName);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Generally, with the current library design, it is necessary to explicitly select the medium
model for each component in a circuit. This model is then propagated to the ports,
and a Modelica translator will check that the quantity and unit attributes
of connected interfaces are identical. Therefore, an error occurs,
if connected FluidPorts do not have a medium with the same medium name.<br>
Automatic propagation of fluid models through the ports is not directly possible with the
Modelica 3.4 specification, but might be supported by the Modelica tool. For example,
in Dymola the option <code>Advanced.MediaPropagation</code>=<code>1</code> can be set
to apply automatic propagation of media models in a circuit.
</p>
<p>
The thermodynamic pressure is an <em>effort</em> variable, which means that the connection
of two or more ports states that the port pressures are the same.
</p>
<p>
The mass flow rate is a <em>flow</em> variable, which means that the connection of two or
more ports states that the sum of all flow rates is zero.
</p>
<p>
The last variable is a <em>stream</em> variable, i.e., a specific quantity carried by the
flow variable. The quantity on the connector always
corresponds to the value close to the connection point, assuming that the fluid is
flowing out of the connector, regardless of the actual direction of the flow. This helps
avoiding singularities when the mass flow goes through zero. The stream properties for the
other flow direction can be inquired with the built-in operator inStream(..), while the
value of the stream variable corresponding to the actual flow direction can be inquired
through the built-in operator <a href=\"https://specification.modelica.org/v3.4/Ch15.html#stream-operator-actualstream\">actualStream(..)</a>.
</p>
<p>
The actual equations corresponding to these operators are introduced and solved automatically
by the tool. In principle, they correspond to the balance equation
sum(flow_variable) = 0 and sum(flow_variable*stream_variable_at_connection) = 0 applied to the set of connected ports. In this case the first equation is the mass balance sum(m_flow) = 0, and the second is the energy balance at the connection point sum(m_flow*h_connection) = 0.
</p>
<p>
In the simpler case of a one-to-one connections between port_a and port_b,
inStream(port_a.h_outflow) just returns port_b.h_outflow. For multiple-way connections,
mixing equations are generated, and special care is taken in order to avoid discontinuities
around zero flow rates. For more details, see this
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Documentation/Fluid/Stream-Connectors-Overview-Rationale.pdf\">presentation</a>
which illustrates the stream concept rationale and the underlying technicalities.
</p>

<p>
A connector should have only the minimal number of variables to
describe the interface, otherwise there will be connection
restrictions in certain cases. Therefore, in the connector
no redundant variables are present, e.g., the temperature T
is not present because it can be computed from the connector
variables pressure p and specific enthalpy h.
</p>

<p>
Here are two simple examples to illustrate modeling with stream connectors. The first
one is a rigid adiabatic volume mixing two flows, where the kinetic and gravitational
terms in the energy balance are neglected for simplicity.
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
<strong>model</strong> MixingVolume \"Volume that mixes two flows\"
  <strong>import</strong> Modelica.Units.SI;
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialPureSubstance;
  FluidPort port_a(redeclare package Medium = Medium) \"Fluid connector a\";
  FluidPort port_b(redeclare package Medium = Medium) \"Fluid connector b\";
  <strong>parameter</strong> SI.Volume V \"Volume of device\";
  SI.Mass             m \"Mass in device\";
  SI.Energy           U \"Inner energy in device\";
  Medium.BaseProperties medium(preferredMediumStates=true) \"Medium in the device\";
<strong>equation</strong>
  // Definition of port variables
  port_a.p         = medium.p;
  port_b.p         = medium.p;
  port_a.h_outflow = medium.h;  // The stream variable always corresponds to the
  port_b.h_outflow = medium.h;  // properties of the fluid holdup (outgoing flow)

  // Total quantities
  m = V*medium.d;
  U = m*medium.u;
  // Mass and energy balance (actualStream(..) is a built-in operator for streams to
  // compute the right h, depending on the flow direction)
  der(m) = port_a.m_flow + port_b.m_flow;
  der(U) = port_a.m_flow*actualStream(port_a.h_outflow) +
           port_b.m_flow*actualStream(port_b.h_outflow);
<strong>end</strong> MixingVolume;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The second example is the model of a component describing a lumped pressure loss
between two ports, with no energy storage and no heat transfer. An isenthalpic
transformation is assumed (changes in kinetic and potential energy between
inlet and outlet are neglected).
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<strong>model</strong> PressureLoss \"Pressure loss component\"
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialPureSubstance;
  FluidPort port_a(redeclare package Medium = Medium) \"Fluid connector a\";
  FluidPort port_b(redeclare package Medium = Medium) \"Fluid connector b\";
  Medium.ThermodynamicState port_a_state_inflow \"State at port_a if inflowing\";
  Medium.ThermodynamicState port_b_state_inflow \"State at port_b if inflowing\";
  Medium.Density d_a \"Density at port a if inflowing\";
  Medium.Density d_b \"Density at port b if inflowing\";
  <strong>replaceable</strong> function f = SomeSpecificMassFlowFunction
    \"Function to compute the mass flow rate\";
<strong>equation</strong>
  // Medium states for inflowing fluid
  port_a_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_a.p, inStream(port_a.h_outflow));
  port_b_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_b.p, inStream(port_b.h_outflow));
  // Mass balance
  0 = port_a.m_flow + port_b.m_flow;
  // Instantaneous propagation of enthalpy flow between the ports with
  // isenthalpic state transformation (no storage and no loss of energy)
  port_a.h_outflow = inStream(port_b.h_outflow);
  port_b.h_outflow = inStream(port_a.h_outflow);
  // (Regularized) Momentum balance
  port_a.m_flow = f(port_a.p - port_b.p, d_a, d_b);
<strong>end</strong> PressureLoss;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If many such components are connected in series between two models with storage, the
specific enthalpies are propagated in both directions and available to all pressure
loss components, without problems when the mass flow goes through zero. The function&nbsp;f
then uses either d_a or d_b depending on the sign of port_a.p-port_b.p, with a
suitable regularization around zero to avoid discontinuities.
</p>

<p>
Please note that these models are highly idealized in order to explain the stream connector
concept. Device models in the library are much more complete, handling issues such as
initialization, steady vs. dynamic modelling, heat transfer from the outside, etc.
</p>

<h4>Multiple-substance media</h4>
<p>
Modelica.Fluid can handle models where the fluid contains multiple substances, so that its
composition can be characterized by mass fraction vectors.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<strong>connector</strong> FluidPort
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
    \"Medium model of the fluid\";
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.MassFlowRate m_flow
    \"Mass flow rate from the connection point into the component\";
  Medium.AbsolutePressure p
    \"Thermodynamic pressure in the connection point\";
  <strong>stream</strong> Medium.SpecificEnthalpy h_outflow
    \"Specific thermodynamic enthalpy close to the connection point if m_flow &lt; 0\";
  <strong>stream</strong> Medium.MassFraction Xi_outflow[Medium.nXi]
    \"Independent mixture mass fractions m_i/m close to the connection point if m_flow &lt; 0\";
  <strong>stream</strong> Medium.ExtraProperty C_outflow[Medium.nC]
    \"Properties c_i/m close to the connection point if m_flow &lt; 0\";
<strong>end</strong> FluidPort;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The mass fraction vectors Xi and C are also stream quantities, as they are carried by the mass
flow rate. The corresponding connection equations are sum(m_flow*Xi) and sum(m_flow*C), which correspond to mass balances for the single substances. The vector Xi contains the mass fractions
of the main components of the fluid, and is used together with p and h to determine the
thermodynamic state of the fluid. The vector C contains the mass fraction of the trace components,
which are accounted for in mass balances, but is ignored when computing the fluid properties. This
allows to easily declare and use medium models with trace components starting from existing medium
models (e.g., adding CO<sub>2</sub> traces to Moist Air for air conditioning models).
</p>

<h4>Approximations in balance equations at connection point</h4>
<p>
Summing up, when two or more ports of the type FluidPort are connected, the following
equations are generated by the tool:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
sum(port_j.m_flow) = 0;               // Total Mass balance
port_j = port_k;                      // Momentum balance
sum(port_j.m_flow*h_connection) = 0;  // Energy balance
sum(port_j.m_flow*Xi_connection) = 0; // Single component mass balances
sum(port_j.m_flow*C_connection) = 0;  // Trace components mass balances
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
It is <strong>very important</strong> to bear in mind that
</p>
<ul>
<li> the mass balances are always exact;</li>
<li> the momentum and energy balance are only exact when two port with the same
diameter are connected, because there is no friction and no change in fluid velocity.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In all other cases, i.e., different port diameters and/or multiple port connections:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The momentum balance does not consider friction effects and changes of pressure due to changes
in velocity.</li>
<li> There might thus be errors in the momentum balance of the order of magnitude
of the dynamic pressure &rho;v<sup>2</sup>/2.</li>
<li> The energy balance does not consider the kinetic terms (gravity terms cancel out due
to the infinitesimal size of the connection volume). There might thus be errors in the momentum balance of the order of magnitude of the kinetic energy v^2/2.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In many applications, where fluid speeds are low and thermal phenomena are mainly of interest,
these approximations are commonly made and lead to acceptable results.
In all other cases, explicit fitting and junction models should be used, that model explicitly
all the kinetic phenomena with the appropriate level of detail.

<p>
This formulation separates the internal energy of the fluid from the kinetic energy of fluid flow.
The internal energy is treated by the energy balance 2, the kinetic energy is treated by the momentum balance equally well.
The evaluation of medium properties, which are independent of the kinetic energy, and the formulation of many fluid models is simplified with the energy balance 2.
The overall conservation of energy is achieved by considering the mutual dependencies of energy and momentum balance.
</p>
<p>
Some components in the library, like DynamicPipe, provide a rigorous implementation of mass,
momentum and energy balance, using the energy balance 2 equation. Other components, like Valves and
Fittings, neglect the impact of changes of the kinetic energy and potential energy on the energy
balance, because they are usually irrelevant compared to changes due to heat flows. The StaticPipe
component neglects the effect of kinetic energy, but includes the potential energy in the balance,
which might be substantial.

  class UpstreamDiscretization "Upstream discretization"

    annotation (Documentation(info="<html>

<p>
When implementing a Fluid component, the difficult arises that
the value of intensive quantities (such as p, T, &rho;)
shall be accessed from the
<strong>upstream</strong> volume. For example, if the fluid flows
from volume A to volume B, then the intensive quantities of
volume B have no influence on the fluid between the
two volumes. On the other hand, if the flow direction is reversed,
the intensive quantities of volume A have no influence
on the fluid between the two volumes.
</p>
<p>
In the Modelica.Fluid library, such a situation is handled
with the following code fragment
(from Interfaces.PartialTwoPortTransport):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
    <strong>annotation</strong>(choicesAllMatching = <strong>true</strong>);

  Interfaces.FluidPort_a port_a(<strong>redeclare package</strong> Medium = Medium);

    \"Medium state close to port_a for inflowing mass flow\";
  Medium.ThermodynamicState port_b_state_inflow
    \"Medium state close to port_b for inflowing mass flow\";

<strong>equation</strong>
  // Isenthalpic state transformation (no storage and no loss of energy)
  port_a.h_outflow  = <strong>inStream</strong>(port_b.h_outflow);
  port_b.h_outflow  = <strong>inStream</strong>(port_a.h_outflow);

  port_a.Xi_outflow = <strong>inStream</strong>(port_b.Xi_outflow);
  port_b.Xi_outflow = <strong>inStream</strong>(port_a.Xi_outflow);

  // Mass balance
  port_a.m_flow + port_b.m_flow = 0;

  // Medium states for inflowing medium
  port_a_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_a.p, port_b.h_outflow, port_b.Xi_outflow);
  port_b_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_b.p, port_a.h_outflow, port_a.Xi_outflow);

  // Densities close to the parts when mass flows in to the respective port
  port_a_rho_inflow = Medium.density(port_a_state_inflow);
  port_b_rho_inflow = Medium.density(port_b_state_inflow);

  // Pressure drop correlation (k_ab, k_ba are the loss factors for the two flow
  // directions; e.g., for a circular device: k = 8*zeta/(pi*diameter)^2)^2)
  m_flow = Utilities.regRoot2(port_a.p - port_b.p, dp_small,
                              port_a_rho_inflow/k1, port_b_rho_inflow/k2);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The medium states for inflowing media can be used to compute density and dynamic
viscosity which in turn can be use to formulate the pressure drop equation.
The standard pressure drop equation
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
dp = port_a - port_b;
m_flow = sqrt(2/(zeta*diameter))*if dp >= 0 then  sqrt(dp)
                                            else -sqrt(-dp)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
cannot be used, since the function has an infinite derivative at dp=0.
Instead the region around zero mass flow rate must be regularized using
one of the regularization functions of Modelica.Fluid.Utilities.
This requires to have density and/or other medium properties for both
flow directions at the same time. These media properties can be computed
from the medium states of the inflowing fluid at the two ports.
</p>

<p>
If the above component is connected between two volumes, i.e.,
the independent medium variables in port_a and port_b are
usually states, then port_a.h and port_b.h are either states
(i.e., known quantities in the model) or are computed from
states. In either case they are \"known\". In such a situation,
all equations can be directly evaluated without any problems.
Zero or reversed mass flow rate does not pose any problems because
the medium properties are always computed for both flow directions
and are then used in the regularization function.
</p>

<p>
If 3 or more components are connected together, it can be shown
that a system of non-linear algebraic equations appear.
The equations are written by purpose in such a form, that
a tool can select mass flow rates and pressures as iteration
variables of this system. The advantage is that these iteration
variables are continuous and even often differentiable. The
alternative to use the medium states as iteration variables
is not good, because T,h,d are discontinuous for reversing flow
direction.

  class RegularizingCharacteristics "Regularizing characteristics"

<p>
Pressure drop equations and other fluid characteristics are usually
computed by <strong>semi-empirical</strong> equations. Unfortunately, the developers
of semi-empirical equations nearly never take into account that the
equation might be used in a simulation program. As a consequence, these
semi-empirical equations can nearly never be used blindly but must
be slightly modified or adapted in order that obvious
simulation problems are avoided. Below, examples are given to
demonstrate what problems occur and how to regularize the characteristics:
</p>

<h4>Square root function</h4>
<p>
In several empirical formulae, expressions of the following form
are present, e.g., for turbulent flow in a pipe:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
y = <strong>if</strong> x &lt; 0 <strong>then</strong> -<strong>sqrt</strong>( <strong>abs</strong>(x) ) <strong>else</strong> <strong>sqrt</strong>(x)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
A plot of this characteristic is shown in the next figure:
</p>

<div>
<img src=\"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Images/Fluid/UsersGuide/ComponentDefinition/sqrt.png\"
     alt=\"sqrt.png\">
</div>

<p>
The difficulty with this function is that the derivative at x=0 is infinity.
In reality, such a function does not exist. E.g., for pipe flow,
the flow becomes laminar for small velocities and therefore around zero the
sqrt() function is replaced by a linear function. Since the laminar region is
usually of not much practical interest, the above approximation is used.
</p>
<p>
The direct implementation above does not work in Modelica, because
an event is generated when x &lt; 0 changes sign. In order to detect
this event, an event iteration takes place. During the event iteration,
the active if-branch is not changed. For example, assume that x is positive
(= \"else\" branch) and shall become negative. During the event iteration
x is slightly negative and the else branch, i.e., sqrt(x), is evaluated.
Since this results in an imaginary number, an error occurs.
It would be possible to fix this, by using the <strong>noEvent</strong>() operator
to explicitly switch of an event:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
y = <strong>if</strong> <strong>noEvent</strong>(x &lt; 0) <strong>then</strong> -<strong>sqrt</strong>( <strong>abs</strong>(x) ) <strong>else</strong> <strong>sqrt</strong>(x)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Still, it is highly likely that good integrators will not work well
around x=0, because they will recognize that the derivative changes very
sharply and will reduce the step size drastically.
</p>
<p>
There are several solutions around this problem: Around x=0, the sqrt() function
can be replaced by a polynomial of 3rd order which is determined in such a way
that it smoothly touches the sqrt() function, i.e., the whole function is continuous
and continuously differentiable. In the Modelica.Fluid library, implementations of
such critical functions are provided in sublibrary Modelica.Fluid.Utilities.
The above sqrt() type function is computed by function <strong>Utilities.regRoot</strong>().
This function is defined as:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
y := x/(x*x+delta*delta)^0.25;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
where \"delta\" is the size of the small region around zero where the
sqrt() function is approximated by another function. The plot of the
function above is practically identical to the one of the original function.
However, it has a finite derivative at x=0 and is differentiable up to
any order. With the default value of delta=0.01, the difference between
the function above and regRoot(x) is 16% around x=0.01, 0.25% around x=0.1
and 0.0025% around x=1.

One important special case for a pressure loss is the friction at the
wall of a pipe under the assumption of quasi steady state flow (i.e., the
mass flow rate varies only slowly). In this section it is explained how this case is
handled in the Modelica.Fluid library for pipes with
<strong>nonuniform roughness</strong>, including the smooth pipe
as a special case (see
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Fluid.Pipes.BaseClasses.WallFriction\">Pipes.BaseClasses.WallFriction</a>).
The treatment is non-standard in order to get a
numerically well-posed description.
</p>

<p>
For pipes with circular cross section the pressure drop is computed as:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
   dp = &lambda;(Re,&Delta;)*(L/D)*&rho;*v*|v|/2
      = &lambda;(Re,&Delta;)*8*L/(&pi;^2*D^5*&rho;)*m_flow*|m_flow|
      = &lambda;2(Re,&Delta;)*k2*sign(m_flow);

with
   Re     = |v|*D*&rho;/&mu;
          = |m_flow|*4/(&pi;*D*&mu;)
   m_flow = A*v*&rho;
   A      = &pi;*(D/2)^2
   &lambda;2     = &lambda;*Re^2
   k2     = L*&mu;^2/(2*D^3*&rho;)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
where
</p>
<ul>
<li> L is the length of the pipe.</li>
<li> D is the diameter of the pipe. If the pipe has not a
     circular cross section, D = 4*A/P, where A is the cross section
     area and P is the wetted perimeter.</li>
<li> &lambda; = &lambda;(Re,&Delta;) is the \"usual\" wall friction coefficient.</li>
<li> &lambda;2 = &lambda;*Re^2 is the used friction coefficient to get a numerically
     well-posed formulation.</li>
<li> Re = |v|*D*&rho;/&mu; is the Reynolds number.</li>
<li> &Delta; = &delta;/D is the relative roughness where
     \"&delta;\" is
     the absolute \"roughness\", i.e., the averaged height of asperities in the pipe
     (&delta; may change over time due to growth of surface asperities during
      service, see <em>[Idelchik 1994, p. 85, Tables 2-1, 2-2])</em>.</li>
<li> &rho; is the upstream density.</li>
<li> &mu; is the upstream dynamic viscosity.</li>
<li> v is the mean velocity.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The first form with &lambda; is used and presented in textbooks,
see \"blue\" curve in the next figure:
</p>

<div>
<img src=\"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Images/Fluid/Pipes/BaseClasses/PipeFriction1.png\" alt=\"PipeFriction1\">
</div>

<p>
This form is not suited for a simulation program since
&lambda; = 64/Re if Re &lt; 2000, i.e., a division by zero occurs for
zero mass flow rate because Re = 0 in this case.
More useful for a simulation model is the friction coefficient
&lambda;2 = &lambda;*Re^2, because &lambda;2 = 64*Re if Re &lt; 2000 and
therefore no problems for zero mass flow rate occur.
The characteristic of &lambda;2 is shown in the next figure and is
used in Modelica.Fluid:
</p>

<div>
<img src=\"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Images/Fluid/Pipes/BaseClasses/PipeFriction2.png\" alt=\"PipeFriction2\">
</div>

<p>
The pressure loss characteristic is divided into three regions:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Region 1</strong>:
     For <strong>Re &le; 2000</strong>, the flow is <strong>laminar</strong> and the exact solution of the
     3-dim. Navier-Stokes equations (momentum and mass balance) is used under the
     assumptions of steady flow, constant pressure gradient and constant
     density and viscosity (= Hagen-Poiseuille flow) leading to &lambda;2 = 64*Re.
     Therefore:
     <blockquote><pre>
dp = 128*&mu;*L/(&pi;*D^4*&rho;)*m_flow
     </pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li> <strong>Region 3</strong>:
     For <strong>Re &ge; 4000</strong>, the flow is <strong>turbulent</strong>.
     Depending on the calculation direction (see \"inverse formulation\"
     below) either of two explicit equations are used. If the pressure drop dp
     is assumed to be known, &lambda;2 = |dp|/k2. The
     Colebrook-White equation
     <em>[Colebrook 1939; Idelchik 1994, p. 83, eq. (2-9)]</em>:
     <blockquote><pre>1/sqrt(&lambda;) = -2*lg( 2.51/(Re*sqrt(&lambda;)) + 0.27*&Delta;)</pre></blockquote>
     gives an implicit relationship between Re and &lambda;.
     Inserting &lambda;2 = &lambda;*Re^2 allows to solve this equation analytically
     for Re: <blockquote><pre>Re = -2*sqrt(&lambda;2)*lg(2.51/sqrt(&lambda;2) + 0.27*&Delta;)</pre></blockquote>
     Finally, the mass flow rate m_flow is computed from Re via
     m_flow = Re*&pi;*D*&mu;/4*sign(dp).
     These are the <strong>red</strong> curves in the diagrams above.<br>
     If the mass flow rate is assumed known (and therefore implicitly
     also the Reynolds number), then &lambda;2 is computed by an
     approximation of the inverse of the Colebrook-White equation
     <em>[Swamee and Jain 1976;
     Miller 1990, p. 191, eq.(8.4)]</em> adapted to &lambda;2:
     <blockquote><pre>
&lambda;2 = 0.25*(Re/lg(&Delta;/3.7 + 5.74/Re^0.9))^2
     </pre></blockquote>
     The pressure drop is then computed as dp = k2*&lambda;2*sign(m_flow).
     These are the <strong>blue</strong> curves in the diagrams above.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li> <strong>Region 2</strong>:
     For <strong>2000 &le; Re &le; 4000</strong> there is a transition region between laminar
     and turbulent flow. The value of &lambda;2 depends on more factors as just
     the Reynolds number and the relative roughness, therefore only crude
     approximations are possible in this area.<br>
     The deviation from the laminar region depends on the
     relative roughness. A laminar flow at Re=2000 is only reached for smooth pipes.
     The deviation Reynolds number Re1 is computed according to
     <em>[Samoilenko 1968; Idelchik 1994, p. 81, sect. 2.1.21]</em> as:
     <blockquote><pre>Re1 = 745*e^(if &Delta; &le; 0.0065 then 1 else 0.0065/&Delta;)</pre></blockquote>
     These are the <strong>blue</strong> curves in the diagrams above.<br>
     Between Re1=Re1(&delta;/D) and Re2=4000,
     &lambda;2 is approximated by a cubic
     polynomial in the \"lg(&lambda;2) - lg(Re)\" chart (see figures above) such that the
     first derivative is continuous at these two points. In order to avoid
     the solution of non-linear equations, two different cubic polynomials are used
     for the direct and the inverse formulation. This leads to some discrepancies
     in &lambda;2 (= differences between the red and the blue curves).
     This is acceptable, because the transition region is anyway not
     precisely known since the actual friction coefficient depends on
     additional factors and since the operating points are usually
     not in this region.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The absolute roughness &delta; has usually to
be estimated. In <em>[Idelchik 1994, pp. 105-109,
Table 2-5; Miller 1990, p. 190, Table 8-1]</em> many examples are given.
As a short summary:
</p>
<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">
  <tr><td><strong>Smooth pipes</strong></td>
      <td>Drawn brass, copper, aluminium, glass, etc.</td>

<p>
The equations above are valid for incompressible flow.
They can also be applied for <strong>compressible</strong> flow up to about <strong>Ma = 0.6</strong>
(Ma is the Mach number) with a maximum error in &lambda; of about 3 %.
The effect of gas compressibility in a wide region can be taken into
account by the following formula derived by Voronin
<em>[Voronin 1959; Idelchik 1994, p. 97, sect. 2.1.81]</em>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
&lambda;_comp = &lambda;*(1 + (&kappa;-1)/2 * Ma^2)^(-0.47)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
where &kappa; is the isentropic coefficient
(for ideal gases, &kappa; is the ratio of specific heat capacities cp/cv).
An appreciable decrease in the coefficient \"&lambda;_comp\" is observed
only in a narrow transonic region and also at supersonic flow velocities
by about 15% <em>[Idelchik 1994, p. 97, sect. 2.1.81]</em>.
This effect is not yet included in Modelica.Fluid.
Another restriction is that the pressure drop model is valid
only for steady state or slowly changing mass flow rate.
For large fluid acceleration, the pressure drop depends additionally
on the frequency of the changing mass flow rate.
</p>

<h4>Inverse formulation</h4>

<p>
In the \"Advanced menu\" it is possible via parameter
\"from_dp\" to define in which form the
pressure drop equation is actually evaluated (<strong>default</strong> is from_dp = <strong>true</strong>):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
from_dp = <strong>true</strong>:   m_flow = f1(dp)
        = <strong>false</strong>:  dp     = f2(m_flow)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
\"from_dp\" can be useful to avoid nonlinear systems of equations
in cases where the inverse pressure loss function is needed.
</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>
A detailed pressure drop model for pipe wall friction is
provided in the form m_flow = f1(dp, &Delta;) or
dp = f2(m_flow, &Delta;).
These functions are continuous and differentiable,
are provided in an explicit form without solving non-linear equations,
and do behave well also at small mass flow rates. This pressure drop
model can be used stand-alone in a static momentum balance and in
a dynamic momentum balance as the friction pressure drop term.
It is valid for incompressible and compressible flow up to a Mach number of 0.6.

<p>
The control valves in
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Fluid.Valves\">Modelica.Fluid.Valves</a>
have the parameters <strong>Kv</strong> and <strong>Cv</strong>. They are defined
as unit-less variables, but in the description text a unit
is given. The reason for this definition is the following:
</p>

<p>
The basic equation for valves is:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
q = Av*sqrt(dp/rho)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
In SI units, [q] is m3/s, [dp] is Pascal, [rho] is [kg/m3], and Av is an area, thus [Av] = m2. Basically, the equation stems from Bernoulli's law. Av is roughly 1.4 times the area of the valve throat. Now, usually valves aren't so big that their throat area is of the order of magnitude of square meters - depending on the applications it is from a few square millimeters to a few square centimeters. Therefore, in the common engineering practice, the following equations are used:
</p>

<p>
Europe:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
q = Kv sqrt(dp/(rho/rho0)) , with [q] = m3/h, [dp] = bar
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
US:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
q = Cv sqrt(dp/(rho/rho0)) , with [q] = USG/min, [dp] = psi
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
In both cases rho0 is the density of cold water at 4 &deg;C, 999 kg/m3. Note that these equations use relative, not absolute densities.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that Kv = 1e6/27.7*Av and Cv = 1e6/24*Av, so both US and EU engineers get more or less the same numbers (just by sheer luck), with a range between a few units and a few hundred units for typical industrial applications, and everybody is happy.
</p>

<p>
Now, we've got two problems here. First, depending on the unit, we change the equation: with SI units, we use the density, with non-SI units, we use the relative density. So the quantities (not only the units!) of Av and Cv/Kv are different.
</p>

<p>
Second, the units of Kv and Cv are usually labeled \"m3/h\" and \"USG/min\", but as a matter of fact they are different, as can be seen from the equations above: they are actually
m3/(h*sqrt(bar)) and USG/(min*sqrt(psi)). If I have a valve with Kv = 10 m3/h, it means I get 10 m3/h \"for a pressure drop of 1 bar\". Unfortunately, this is not correct from the point of view of strict dimensional analysis, but nobody uses sqrt(Pa) or sqrt(bar).
</p>

<p>
You might think this is crazy (it is, especially when you try to explain it), but as a matter of fact the valve coefficient is <strong>never</strong> given in square meters in any catalog or datasheet; Cv is still the most used (even in Europe), followed by Kv. So, it will be very inconvenient for users to type in Av in square meters.
</p>

<p>
The pragmatic approach used in Modelica.Fluid.ControlValves is to accept the fact that m3/h and USG/min are not the real units of Cv and Kv, so we can't use the general unit conversion mechanism, put them just as mnemonic labels in the comment, use non-dimensional coefficients in the interface, and then define properly dimensioned unit conversion within the model

<p>
The Modelica.Fluid library is designed so that each model of a system must
include an instance <code>system</code> of the <code>System</code> component at the top level, in the same way as the <code>World</code> model of the MultiBody Library. The System component contains the parameters that
describe the environment surrounding the components (ambient pressure and
temperature, gravity acceleration), and also provides default settings
for many parameters which are used consistently by the models in the library.
These parameters are then propagated to the individual components
using the inner/outer variable mechanism. In case the system model is structured
hierarchically, it is possible to either put a single System
component at the top level, or possibly to put many of them at different levels,
which will only influence the system components from that level down.
</p>
<p>All the parameters defined in the System model are used as default values for the parameters of the individual components of the system model. Note that it is always possible to override these defaults locally by changing the value of the parameters in the specific component instance.
</p>
<ul>
<li> The <em>General</em> tab of the System model allows to set the default environment variables (pressure, temperature and gravity)
used by all the components.
</li>
<li> The <em>Assumptions</em> tab allows to change the default modelling assumptions
used by all the components (see the section <em>Customizing a system model later</em>)</li>
<li> The <em>Initialization</em> tab allows to define default start values for mass flow rates, pressures and temperatures in the model; this can be useful to help nonlinear solver converge to the solution of any nonlinear system of equations that involves such variables, by providing meaningful guess values.</li>
<li> The <em>Advanced</em> tab contains default values for parameters used in
the advanced settings of some components.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Remember to <strong>always add a System component</strong> at the top level of
your system model, otherwise you will get errors when compiling the model. The tool will automatically name it <code>system</code>, so that it
is recognized by all other components.

all of them within a GUI, and set them simultaneously (as they are

The Assumptions | allowFlowReversal parameter determines whether reversing flow conditions
(i.e., flow direction opposite to design direction) are modelled or not. By default,
reversing flow conditions are considered by the models, but this causes a significant increase
of complexity in the equations, due to the conditional equations depending on the flow direction.
If you know in advance that the flow in a certain component (or in the whole system) will always
be in the design direction, then setting this parameter to false will produce a much faster and

         <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.PartialDistributedVolume\">Interfaces.PartialDistributedVolume</a> and
         <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.PartialDistributedFlow\">Interfaces.PartialDistributedFlow</a>,
         besides <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.PartialTwoPort\">Interfaces.PartialTwoPort</a>.</li>
     </ul>
     All non-trivial mass and energy balances of Vessels, Machines and Fittings have been replaced with PartialLumpedVolume.
     The mass and energy balances of Pipes are based on PartialDistributedVolume.<br>
     See <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Fluid.Examples.BranchingDynamicPipes\">Examples.BranchingDynamicPipes</a>
     for an example utilizing the complete balance equations.</li>

<li> New approach for the connection of distributed flow models<br>
     The staggered grid approach offers different choices for the connection approach. So far the preferred modeling was to put full mass balances
     into the pipes and expose half momentum balances through the ports (ModelStructure a_v_b).
     This resulted in nonlinear equation systems for pressure/flow correlations in connection sets.
     A new default ModelStructure av_vb has been introduced putting full momentum balances into the models and
     exposing half mass balances through the ports (av_vb replaces the former avb). This way the nonlinear equation systems are avoided.
     High-index DAEs need to be treated instead in connection sets.
     Alternatively a Fitting like SuddenExpansion can be introduced to account for different cross flow areas of connected flow models.</li>

<li> New Vessels.BaseClasses.PartialLumpedVessel treating the ports, including hydraulic resistances, for ClosedVolume, SimpleTank and SweptVolume.</li>

<li> Clarification of modeling assumptions<br>
     The documentation has been extended to better explain the modeling assumptions made. In particular the section
     <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Fluid.UsersGuide.ComponentDefinition.FluidConnectors\">UsersGuide.ComponentDefinition.FluidConnectors</a>
     now makes clear that the ports represent the thermodynamic enthalpy, as opposed to stagnation enthalpy,
     and thermodynamic or static pressure, as opposed to total pressure. An new package Explanatory has been added to the
     examples to show the difference between static pressure and total pressure and possible implications. See
     <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Fluid.Examples.Explanatory.MomentumBalanceFittings\">Examples.Explanatory.MomentumBalanceFittings</a>.</li>

<li> System (former Ambient)<br>
     The use of the global System object has been extended towards common default values for
     modeling assumptions, initialization, and advanced settings that are different for each application of the library
     but should nevertheless provide default values for reasons of convenience.
     In particular steady-state initialization and complete steady-state simulation can now be specified system-wide.
     A new Types.Init.Dynamics has been introduced, combining steady-state and initial conditions.
     The former Types.Init has become obsolete.
     <br>See <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Fluid.Examples.HeatingSystem\">Examples.HeatingSystem</a></li>

<li> Extension of pumps for better consideration of zero flow and heat transfer with environment<br>
     The simplified mass and energy balances have been replaced with a rigorous formulation.
     Moreover an optional heat transfer model can be configured for heat exchanged with the environment or the housing.<br>
     See <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Fluid.Machines.BaseClasses.PartialPump\">Machines.BaseClasses.PartialPump</a></li>

<li> Refinement of valves for flow reversal<br>
     All valves now use upstream discretization for reversing flow conditions.</li>

<li> Finalization of trace substances<br>
     Modelica.Fluid now provides a sound implementation for trace substances,
     which can easily be added to existing Media models, in order to study their evolution in a fluid system.<br>
     See <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Fluid.Examples.TraceSubstances.RoomCO2WithControls\">Examples.TraceSubstances.RoomCO2WithControls</a></li>

<li> Vectorized ports for volumes<br>
     The ports of models that typically have large volumes, like Vessels and Sources,
     have been vectorized. Formerly the connection of multiple flow models to the same port
     of such volume models resulted in unintended mixing equations for stream variables
     in connection sets outside the volumes. The mixing takes place inside the volumes
     when using multiple ports. Moreover a
     <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Fluid.Fittings.MultiPort\">Fittings.MultiPort</a>
     has been introduced. It can be attached to components like pipes,
     which do not have vectorized ports on their own.</li>

<li> Inverse parameterization of flow models with nominal operational conditions<br>
     Flow models have been added or extended to support the parameterization with nominal values
     (Machines.ControlledPump, Orifices.SimpleGenericOrifice, Pipes.BaseClasses.FlowModels.NominalTurbulentFlow).
     They are intended for early phases of system modeling, if geometries and flow characteristics
     are of secondary interest. As these models use the same interfaces, base classes and naming conventions,
     they can easily be replaced with more detailed models
     as more information shall be taken into account later on.<br>
     See <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Fluid.Examples.InverseParameterization\">Examples.InverseParameterization</a></li>

<li> Replaceable HeatTransfer models<br>
     The Vessels and the Machines now have replaceable HeatTransfer models,
     besides the Pipes. All HeatTransfer models are optional.
     The heat transfer models are parameterized with the Medium and the ThermodynamicState
     of involved flow segments.<br>
     See <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.PartialHeatTransfer\">Interfaces.PartialHeatTransfer</a>.</li>

<li> All examples are working now (using Dymola 7.1).<br>
     The number of examples has been extended with the former critical test cases
     HeatingSystem and IncompressibleFluidNetwork. Moreover the HeatExchangers have been
     moved into Examples.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Version 1.0 Streams Beta 3, 2008-10-12</h4>

<p>
Modelica.Fluid was further improved:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Volumes, tanks, junctions<br>
     Added asserts to require that ports are connected at most once.
     If a user would perform more than one connection, ideal mixing
     takes place for the connected components and this is nearly never
     what the user would like to have</li>

<li> Ambient<br>
     Renamed Ambient to System, including adaptation of models.<br>
     Introduced default values system.flowDirection and
     as a comment system.initType. system.flowDirection is used in
     two port components as default.</li>

<li> GenericJunction<br>
     Corrected specification of flowDirection.<br>
     Added a HeatPort.</li>

<li> PartialDistributedFlow models<br>
     Adapted determination of velocities to usage of
     upstream properties at ports.<br>
     Corrected and unified initialization of p_start[*] values.</li>

<li> DistributedPipe models<br>
     Changed treatment of port densities and viscosities
     to the treatment of the lumped pipe model. This way events are
     avoided if the mass flow rate crosses or approaches zero.<br>
     Correct determination of Reynolds numbers.<br>
     Added test model DistributedPipeClosingValve.</li>

<li> ControlValves<br>
     Changed flowCharacteristic into valveCharacteristic<br>
     Removed parameter Kv and added dp_nom, m_flow_nom from linear
     and discrete valve interfaces. Added test cases.<br>
     Adapted Examples to new LinearValve and DiscreteValve,
     using nominal values instead of Kv.<br>
     Changed default flow coefficient selection to OpPoint</li>

<li> Fixed units for Kv and Cv in control valve models.</li>

<li> Updated tests for valves.</li>

<li> Bug in Modelica.Fluid.Test.TestComponents.Pumps.TestWaterPump2 corrected
     (complicated redeclaration issue).</li>

<li> Adapted AST_BatchPlant so that \"Check\" is successful.
     Simulation fails after 600 s.</li>

<li> Introduced
     density_pTX(Medium.p_default, Medium.T_default, Medium.X_default)
     as default value for nominal densities (previously it was a literal
     such as 1000).</li>

<li> Pumps<br>
     Updated energy balance equations for pumps (no division by zero anymore,
     fixed several bugs related to Np).<br>
     Added two more test cases for pumps.<br>
     Fixed pump initialization options.</li>

<li> PartialPump<br>
     Explanation for the energy balanced added as comment<br>
     \"h=0\" replaced by \"h=Medium.h_default\" since otherwise an assert is triggered
     if \"h=0\" is not in the medium range.<br>
     Fluid ports positioned in the middle line
     and using the same size as for all other components.</li>

<li> Pumps.Pump<br>
     Resized input connector, so that it has the same size as the
     standard input connectors.<br>
     Changed icon text to input connector to \"N_in [rpm]\".<br>
     Added unit rev/min to the external and internal input connector.</li>

<li> PartialValve<br>
     fillcolor=white added to icon<br>
     made line Thickness = Single,
     since icon does not look nice sometimes</li>

<li> All components<br>
     Changed %name color from black to blue
     (is a conversion bug, since Modelica 2 has blue as default
     color whereas Modelica 3 has black and Dymola is not
     taking care off this).</li>

<li> Sources<br>
     Made icon elements invisible, if corresponding input is disabled.</li>

<li> Valves, Pipes, PressureLosses, HeatExchangers, two port senors<br>
     Added an arrow in the icon for the \"design flow direction\" from
     port_a to port_b.</li>

<li> Moved default initialization in \"System\" in to a comment, since no effect yet</li>

<li> Added the explanation from Francesco for Kv, Cv for valves in the
     User's Guide and added links in the corresponding valves to this description</li>
</ul>

<p>
\"Check\" for the library is successful. \"Check with Simulation\"
(i.e., simulating all test models in the library) is successful
with the exceptions:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Examples.AST_BatchPlant.BatchPlant_StandardWater<br>
     Need to be fixed in a later release (requires quite a lot of work).</li>
<li> Test.TestOverdeterminedSteadyStateInit.Test5<br>
     Test.TestOverdeterminedSteadyStateInit.Test6<br>
     These are test cases where too much initial conditions are given.
     The goal is to work on methods how this can be handled.
     So, this is a principal problem that these models do not simulate.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 1.0 Streams Beta 2, 2008-10-08</h4>

<p>
Modelica.Fluid was transformed to Modelica 3 and to Modelica Standard
library 3.0 (by automatic conversion). Further changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Emulated enumerations changed to real enumerations.</li>
<li> Improved ControlValves code</li>
<li> Introduced stream connectors with stream keyword (was previously an annotation)</li>
<li> Introduced inStream() instead of inflow()</li>
<li> Introduced m_flow*actualStream(h_outflow) instead of
     streamFlow() or semiLinear(m_flow, inStream(h_outflow), medium.h)</li>
<li> Removed Modelica.Fluid.Media and all references to it (since now available
     in Modelica.Media of MSL3.0).</li>
<li> Fixed PartialLumpedVolume for media with multiple substances</li>
<li> New function \"Utilities.RegFun3\" for regularization with static head</li>
<li> Fix density in static head models with the new RegFun3 functions
     (ticket 7)</li>
<li> Minor bug in MixingVolume corrected:<br>
     V_lumped and Wb_flow have been set as modifiers when extending from PartialLumpedVolume,
     although they are not declared as input. This is not allowed in Modelica 3.
     Fixed by replacing the modifiers by equations.</li>
<li> Modelica.Fluid.Sources.FixedBoundary<br>
     Introduced p_default, T_default, h_default as default values, since
     otherwise warnings will always be printed because parameter value is missing.</li>
<li> Modelica.Fluid.Sources.Boundary_pT<br>
     Modelica.Fluid.Sources.Boundary_ph<br>
     Modelica.Fluid.Sources.MassFlowSource_T<br>
     Changed default values of parameters reference_p, reference_T to
     p_default, T_default (some have been xx_default, some reference_xx,
     it seems best to always use the same approach)</li>
<li> Modelica.Fluid.Pipes.BaseClasses.PartialDistributedFlow<br>
     Added default value for parameter \"rho_nominal\" =
     Medium.density_pTX(Medium.p_default, Medium.T_default, Medium.X_default)
     in order to avoid unnecessary warning messages.
     Should be replaced by \"Medium.rho_default\", once available.</li>
<li> Modelica.Fluid.Pipes.DistributedPipe<br>
     Modelica.Fluid.Pipes.DistributedPipeSb<br>
     Modelica.Fluid.Pipes.DistributedPipeSa<br>
     Added default value for parameter \"mu_nominal\"
    (computed with default values of p,T,X from dynamicViscosity(..))</li>
<li> Modelica.Fluid.Pipes.BaseClasses.PartialDistributedFlowLumpedPressure<br>
     Replaced default value \"rho_nominal=0.01\" by
     Medium.density_pTX(Medium.p_default, Medium.T_default, Medium.X_default)</li>
<li> Modelica.Fluid.Volumes.OpenTank<br>
     Modelica.Fluid.Volumes.Tank<br>
     Corrected icons of ports (wrongly sized by automatic conversion from
     Modelica 2 to Modelica 3).</li>
<li> Examples.BranchingDistributedPipes<br>
     Modelica.Fluid.Test.TestComponents.Junctions.TestGenericJunction<br>
     Modelica.Fluid.Test.TestComponents.Pipes.TestDistributedPipe01<br>
     Parameters dp_nom, m_flow_nom are not defined in junction components.
     Values provided.</li>
<li> PressureLosses.BaseClasses.QuadraticTurbulent.BaseModel<br>
     No default or start values for \"parameter LossFactorData data\"
     Changed the model to \"partial model\" to avoid warning messages</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 1.0 Streams Beta 1, 2008-05-02</h4>

<p>

</ul>

<p>
Other changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Introduced HeatPorts with vectorized icon in Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces</li>
<li> Deleted Modelica.Fluid.WorkInProgress since it seems to be too much work
     to convert it to stream connectors</li>
<li> Added Modelica.Fluid.Media (contains ConstantLiquidWater
     medium because functions are missing in Modelica.Media)</li>
<li> Added two additional test cases with LumpedPipes
    (to identify problems with hierarchically connected stream connectors).</li>
<li> Deleted TestPortVolumes since PortVolumes can no longer be implemented with
     stream connectors</li>
<li> Leakage flow introduced for valves</li>
<li> DrumBoiler Example corrected</li>
<li> Regularization for sensors (T,h,...), in order that no discontinuity
     for bi-directional flow</li>
<li> Density computation in static head corrected</li>
<li> New functions Utilities.regUnitStep, regStep</li>
<li> New components (TestComponents.Sensors.TestOnePortSensors1/.TestOnePortSensors2l,
     TestRegStep)</li>
<li> PartialTwoPortTransport<br>
     <ul>
     <li> Introduced port_a.T, port_b.T (for plotting)</li>
     <li> Removed initialization menu</li>

     <li> Removed previous start values of PartialTwoPortTransport in all models</li>
     </ul></li>
<li> PartialPump: Removed p_nom, since no longer needed (only dp_nom)</li>
<li> Made \"%name\" in the icons of all components unified (and better looking)</li>
<li> Changed default value of leakage flow of valves to zero.</li>
<li> Fixed Modelica.Fluid.Junctions.MassFlowRatio so that it compiles
     (inflow(..) currently only supported for scalars, not for vectors)</li>
<li> Added script libraryinfo.mos, in order that Modelica.Fluid appears in the
     Dymola library window automatically (provided library is in MODELICAPATH)</li>
<li> Replaced semiLinear(..) by streamFlow(..) (not yet at all places)</li>
<li> Introduced check-boxes in parameter menu of Sources (is more convenient to use)</li>
<li> TwoPortTransport<br>
     Computation of V_flow and optionally port_a_T, port_b_T.
     Error in temperature calculation corrected</li>
<li> Tank:<br>
     Default of bottom pipe diameter changed from 0 to 0.1, since
     otherwise a division by zero (if not connected and not changed).</li>
<li> Modelica.Fluid.ControlValves.ValveVaporizing:<br>
     Due to changes in PartialTwoPortTransport, port_a_T_inflow does no longer exist
     and the usage to it is removed.
     </li>
<li> Modelica.Fluid.Test.TestComponents.Sensors.TestTemperatureSensor:<br>
     Due to changes in PartialTwoPortTransport,
     p_start does no longer exist and the usage to it is removed.</li>
<li> VersionBuild introduced, as well as automatic update of
     VersionBuild/VersionDate</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 1.0 Beta 4, 2008-04-26</h4>

     package Examples.</li>
<li> Moved Examples from <strong>file</strong> Modelica.Fluid/package.mo to
     Modelica.Media/Examples <strong>subdirectory</strong> and created separate
     file per sub-package. This shall simplify the maintenance of
     examples by different authors</li>
<li> Moved Interfaces from file Modelica.Fluid/package.mo to
     Modelica.Fluid/Interfaces.mo</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 0.793, 2004-05-18</h4>

     Modelica 2.1 built-in operator in Dymola.</li>
<li> Minor bug in \"Components.ShortPipe\" corrected.</li>
<li> Bug in \"Components.Orifice\" corrected
     (dp was previously calculated in

</ul>
<h4>Version 0.792, 2003-11-07</h4>
<p>
This is the first consolidated version made up from
several changes for Modelica'2003.
Modelica.Fluid is still quite far away
from a library that could be included in the Modelica
standard library.
</p>
<h4>Previous Releases</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Oct., 2003</em><br>

       Fluid library split into two packages: Modelica.Media
       that contains the media models and Modelica.Fluid that
       contains fluid flow components. Modelica.Media is
       independent of Modelica.Fluid and my be used also from
       other packages that may have a different design as
       Modelica.Fluid.</li>

       replaced number of massFractions from n to n-1 in order
       that usage of model for single substances is easier
       and in order that no special cases have to be treated
       in the equations (previously the massFraction equations had to
       be removed for single substance flow; now they are removed
       automatically, since the dimensions are zero, and not one
       as previously), included asserts to check the validity of
       the medium models, included the dynamic viscosity in the
       medium models, adapted the examples and medium models to the

<h4>Acknowledgements</h4>

<p>
The development of this library has been a collaborative effort
and many have contributed.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The previous design of this library (until beginning of 2008) was based on the paper
     Elmqvist H., Tummescheit H., and Otter M.:
     <a href=\"https://www.modelica.org/events/Conference2003/papers/h40_Elmqvist_fluid.pdf\">Object-Oriented Modeling of Thermo-Fluid Systems</a>.
     Modelica 2003 Conference, Link&ouml;ping, Sweden, pp. 269-286, Nov. 3-4, 2003.<br>
     This design has been partly changed, especially by the introduction of the streams
     concept.</li>

<li>The Fluid library development was organized in 2002-2004 by Martin
     Otter, since 2004 it is organized by Francesco Casella, and
     since 2008 it is organized jointly by Francesco Casella and R&uuml;diger Franke.</li>

<li>Francesco Casella included several components of his ThermoPower
     library with some rewriting. The stream connector concept used in Modelica.Fluid is
     based on a similar concept developed by him for the ThermoPower library.</li>

<li>R&uuml;diger Franke initiated the stream connector concept as an extension
     and improved version of the ThermoPower concept. In Nov. 2008 - Jan. 2009 he
     greatly restructured and improved the library.</li>

<li>Michael Wetter introduced trace constituents in Modelica.Fluid consistently and
     provided corresponding examples under Examples.TraceSubstances.</li>

Library <strong>Modelica.Fluid</strong> is a <strong>free</strong> Modelica package providing components for
<strong>1-dimensional thermo-fluid flow</strong> in networks of pipes. A unique feature is that the
component equations and the media models
as well as pressure loss and heat transfer correlations are decoupled from each other.
All components are implemented such that they can be used for
media from the Modelica.Media library. This means especially that an
incompressible or compressible medium, a single or a multiple
substance medium with one or more phases might be used.

Library <strong>Modelica.Fluid</strong> is a <strong>free</strong> Modelica package providing components for
<strong>1-dimensional thermo-fluid flow</strong> in networks of vessels, pipes, fluid machines, valves and fittings.
A unique feature is that the component equations and the media models
as well as pressure loss and heat transfer correlations are decoupled from each other.
All components are implemented such that they can be used for
media from the Modelica.Media library. This means especially that an

In the next figure, several features of the library are demonstrated with
a simple heating system with a closed flow cycle. By just changing one configuration parameter in the system object the equations are changed between steady-state and dynamic simulation with fixed or steady-state initial conditions.

<p>
With respect to previous versions, the design
of the connectors has been changed in a non-backward compatible way,
using the recently developed concept
of stream connectors that results in much more reliable simulations
(see also <a href=\"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Documentation/Fluid/Stream-Connectors-Overview-Rationale.pdf\">Stream-Connectors-Overview-Rationale.pdf</a>).
This extension was included in Modelica 3.1.
