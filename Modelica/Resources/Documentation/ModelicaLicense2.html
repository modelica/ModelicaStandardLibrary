    <p><strong>Preamble.</strong> The goal of this license is that Modelica
    related model libraries, software, images, documents, data files etc. can
    be used freely in the original or a modified form, in open source and in
    commercial environments (as long as the license conditions below are
    fulfilled, in particular sections&nbsp;2c) and 2d). The Original Work is
    provided free of charge and the use is completely at your own risk.
    Developers of free Modelica packages are encouraged to utilize this license
    for their work.</p>
    <p>The Modelica License applies to any Original Work that contains the
    following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice(s) for this
    Original Work:</p>
    <p><strong>Licensed by the Modelica Association under the Modelica
    License&nbsp;2</strong></p>
    <p><strong>1. Definitions.</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>&ldquo;License&rdquo; is this Modelica License.</li>
        <li>&ldquo;Original Work&rdquo; is any work of authorship, including
        software, images, documents, data files, that contains the above
        licensing notice or that is packed together with a licensing notice
        referencing it.</li>
        <li>&ldquo;Licensor&rdquo; is the provider of the Original Work who has
        placed this licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice(s) for
        the Original Work. The Original Work is either directly provided by the
        owner of the Original Work, or by a licensee of the owner.</li>
        <li>&ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo; is any modification of the Original
        Work which represents, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For
        the matter of clarity and as examples:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Derivative Work shall not include work that remains
                separable from the Original Work, as well as merely extracting
                a part of the Original Work without modifying it.</li>
                <li>Derivative Work shall not include (a) fixing of errors
                and/or (b) adding vendor specific Modelica annotations and/or
                (c) using a subset of the classes of a Modelica package, and/or
                (d) using a different representation, e.g., a binary
                representation.</li>
                <li>Derivative Work shall include classes that are copied from
                the Original Work where declarations, equations or the
                documentation are modified.</li>
                <li>Derivative Work shall include executables to simulate the
                models that are generated by a Modelica translator based on the
                Original Work (of a Modelica package).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>&ldquo;Modified Work&rdquo; is any modification of the Original
        Work with the following exceptions: (a) fixing of errors and/or (b)
        adding vendor specific Modelica annotations and/or (c) using a subset
        of the classes of a Modelica package, and/or (d) using a different
        representation, e.g., a binary representation.</li>
        <li>&ldquo;Source Code&rdquo; means the preferred form of the Original
        Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation
        describing how to modify the Original Work.</li>
        <li>&ldquo;You&rdquo; means an individual or a legal entity exercising
        rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this
        License.</li>
        <li>&ldquo;Modelica package&rdquo; means any Modelica library that is
        defined with the
        &ldquo;<code><strong>package</strong>&nbsp;&lt;Name&gt;&nbsp;...&nbsp;<strong>end</strong>&nbsp;&lt;Name&gt;;</code>&rdquo;
        Modelica language element.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>2. Grant of Copyright License.</strong> Licensor grants You a
    worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the
    duration of the copyright, to do the following:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p>To reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as
            part of a collection.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>To create Derivative Works according to Section&nbsp;1d) of this
            License.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>To distribute or communicate to the public copies of the
            <u>Original Work</u> or a <u>Derivative Work</u> under <u>this
            License</u>. No fee, neither as a copyright-license fee, nor as a
            selling fee for the copy as such may be charged under this License.
            Furthermore, a verbatim copy of this License must be included in
            any copy of the Original Work or a Derivative Work under this
            License.<br>
            For the matter of clarity, it is permitted A) to distribute or
            communicate such copies as part of a (possible commercial)
            collection where other parts are provided under different licenses
            and a license fee is charged for the other parts only and B) to
            charge for mere printing and shipping costs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>To distribute or communicate to the public copies of a
            <u>Derivative Work</u>, alternatively to Section&nbsp;2c), under
            <u>any other license</u> of your choice, especially also under a
            license for commercial/proprietary software, as long as You comply
            with Sections&nbsp;3, 4 and 8 below.<br>
            For the matter of clarity, no restrictions regarding fees, either
            as to a copyright-license fee or as to a selling fee for the copy
            as such apply.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>To perform the Original Work publicly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>To display the Original Work publicly.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>3. Acceptance.</strong> Any use of the Original Work or a
    Derivative Work, or any action according to either Section&nbsp;2a) to 2f)
    above constitutes Your acceptance of this License.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Designation of Derivative Works and of Modified
    Works.</strong> The identifying designation of Derivative Work and of
    Modified Work must be different to the corresponding identifying
    designation of the Original Work. This means especially that the
    (root-level) name of a Modelica package under this license must be changed
    if the package is modified (besides fixing of errors, adding vendor
    specific Modelica annotations, using a subset of the classes of a Modelica
    package, or using another representation, e.g. a binary
    representation).</p>
    <p><strong>5. Grant of Patent License.</strong> Licensor grants You a
    worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent
    claims owned by the Licensor or licensed to the Licensor by the owners of
    the Original Work that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by
    the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works
    under the conditions as given in Section&nbsp;2. For the matter of clarity,
    the license regarding Derivative Works covers patent claims to the extent
    as they are embodied in the Original Work only.</p>
    <p><strong>6. Provision of Source Code.</strong> Licensor agrees to provide
    You with a copy of the Source Code of the Original Work but reserves the
    right to decide freely on the manner of how the Original Work is
    provided.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the matter of clarity, Licensor
    might provide only a binary representation of the Original Work. In that
    case, You may (a) either reproduce the Source Code from the binary
    representation if this is possible (e.g., by performing a copy of an
    encrypted Modelica package, if encryption allows the copy operation) or (b)
    request the Source Code from the Licensor who will provide it to You.</p>
    <p><strong>7. Exclusions from License Grant.</strong> Neither the names of
    Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any
    of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote
    products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission
    of the Licensor. Except as otherwise expressly stated in this License and
    in particular in Sections&nbsp;2 and 5, nothing in this License grants any
    license to Licensor&apos;s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any
    other intellectual property, and no patent license is granted to make, use,
    sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent
    claims.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No license is granted to the trademarks
    of Licensor even if such trademarks are included in the Original Work,
    except as expressly stated in this License. Nothing in this License shall
    be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different
    from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a
    right to license.</p>
    <p><strong>8. Attribution Rights.</strong> You must retain in the Source
    Code of the Original Work and of any Derivative Works that You create, all
    author, copyright, patent, or trademark notices, as well as any descriptive
    text identified therein as an &ldquo;Attribution Notice&rdquo;. The same
    applies to the licensing notice of this License in the Original Work. For
    the matter of clarity, &ldquo;author notice&rdquo; means the notice that
    identifies the original author(s).<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must cause the Source Code for any
    Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice
    reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the
    Original Work.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case the Original Work or Derivative
    Work is not provided in Source Code, the Attribution Notices shall be
    appropriately displayed, e.g., in the documentation of the Derivative
    Work.</p>
    <p><strong>9. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br></strong> <u><strong>The Original
    Work is provided under this License on an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; basis and
    without warranty, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
    the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a
    particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality of the Original Work
    is with You.</strong></u> This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an
    essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted
    by this License except under this disclaimer.</p>
    <p><strong>10. Limitation of Liability.</strong> Under no circumstances and
    under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
    otherwise, shall the Licensor, the owner or a licensee of the Original Work
    be liable to anyone for any direct, indirect, general, special, incidental,
    or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
    License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation,
    damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
    malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This
    limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law
    prohibits such limitation.</p>
    <p><strong>11. Termination.</strong> This License conditions your rights to
    undertake the activities listed in Section&nbsp;2 and 5, including your
    right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so
    without observing these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law
    and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect
    copyright exceptions and limitations. This License shall terminate
    immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You
    by this License upon your failure to observe the conditions of this
    license.</p>
    <p><strong>12. Termination for Patent Action.</strong> This License shall
    terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights
    granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action,
    including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor, any owners of
    the Original Work or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes
    a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging
    patent infringement through combinations of the Original Work under
    combination with other software or hardware.</p>
    <p><strong>13. Jurisdiction.</strong> Any action or suit relating to this
    License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
    Licensor resides and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its
    conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations
    Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
    excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or
    after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of
    copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall
    survive the termination of this License.</p>
    <p><strong>14. Attorneys&apos; Fees.</strong> In any action to enforce the terms
    of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party
    shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without
    limitation, reasonable attorneys&apos; fees and costs incurred in connection
    with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall
    survive the termination of this License.</p>
    <p><strong>15. Miscellaneous.</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
        provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
        enforceable.</li>
        <li>No verbal ancillary agreements have been made. Changes and
        additions to this License must appear in writing to be valid. This also
        applies to changing the clause pertaining to written form.</li>
        <li>You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted
        or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to
        interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.</li>

    <p>This section contains questions/answer to users and/or distributors of
    Modelica packages and/or documents under Modelica License&nbsp;2. Note, the
    answers to the questions below are not a legal interpretation of the
    Modelica License&nbsp;2. In case of a conflict, the language of the license
    shall prevail.</p>
    <h6>Using or Distributing a Modelica <u>Package</u> under the Modelica
    License&nbsp;2</h6>
    <p><strong>What are the main differences to the previous version of the
    Modelica License?</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Modelica License&nbsp;1 is unclear whether the licensed Modelica
            package can be distributed under a different license.
            Version&nbsp;2 explicitly allows that &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo;
            can be distributed under any license of Your choice, see examples
            in Section&nbsp;1d) as to what qualifies as Derivative Work (so,
            version&nbsp;2 is clearer).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If You modify a Modelica package under Modelica License&nbsp;2
            (besides fixing of errors, adding vendor specific Modelica
            annotations, using a subset of the classes of a Modelica package,
            or using another representation, e.g., a binary representation),
            you must rename the root-level name of the package for your
            distribution. In version&nbsp;1 you could keep the name (so,
            version&nbsp;2 is more restrictive). The reason of this restriction
            is to reduce the risk that Modelica packages are available that
            have identical names, but different functionality.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Modelica License&nbsp;1 states that &ldquo;It is not allowed to
            charge a fee for the original version or a modified version of the
            software, besides a reasonable fee for distribution and
            support&rdquo;. Version&nbsp;2 has a similar intention for all
            Original Work under <u>Modelica License&nbsp;2</u> (to remain free
            of charge and open source) but states this more clearly as
            &ldquo;No fee, neither as a copyright-license fee, nor as a selling
            fee for the copy as such may be charged&rdquo;. Contrary to
            version&nbsp;1, Modelica License&nbsp;2 has no restrictions on fees
            for Derivative Work that is provided under a different license (so,
            version&nbsp;2 is clearer and has fewer restrictions).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Modelica License&nbsp;2 introduces several useful provisions for
            the licensee (articles&nbsp;5, 6, 12), and for the licensor
            (articles&nbsp;7, 12, 13, 14) that have no counter part in
            version&nbsp;1.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Modelica License&nbsp;2 can be applied to all type of work,
            including documents, images and data files, contrary to
            version&nbsp;1 that was dedicated for software only (so,
            version&nbsp;2 is more general).</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Can I distribute a Modelica package (under Modelica
    License&nbsp;2) as part of my commercial Modelica modeling and simulation
    environment?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, according to Section&nbsp;2c). However, you are not allowed to
    charge a fee for this part of your environment. Of course, you can charge
    for your part of the environment.</p>
    <p><strong>Can I distribute a Modelica package (under Modelica
    License&nbsp;2) under a different license?</strong></p>
    <p>No. The license of an unmodified Modelica package cannot be changed
    according to Sections&nbsp;2c) and 2d). This means that you cannot
    <u>sell</u> copies of it, any distribution has to be free of charge.</p>
    <p><strong>Can I distribute a Modelica package (under Modelica
    License&nbsp;2) under a different license when I first encrypt the
    package?</strong></p>
    <p>No. Merely encrypting a package does not qualify for Derivative Work and
    therefore the encrypted package has to stay under Modelica
    License&nbsp;2.</p>
    <p><strong>Can I distribute a Modelica package (under Modelica
    License&nbsp;2) under a different license when I first add classes to the
    package?</strong></p>
    <p>No. The package itself remains unmodified, i.e., it is Original Work,
    and therefore the license for this part must remain under Modelica
    License&nbsp;2. The newly added classes can be, however, under a different
    license.</p>
    <p><strong>Can I copy a class out of a Modelica package (under Modelica
    License&nbsp;2) and include it</strong> <u><strong>unmodified</strong></u>
    <strong>in a Modelica package under a</strong>
    <u><strong>commercial/proprietary</strong></u>
    <strong>license?</strong></p>
    <p>No, according to article&nbsp;2c). However, you can include model,
    block, function, package, record and connector classes in your Modelica
    package under <u>Modelica License&nbsp;2</u>. This means that your Modelica
    package could be under a commercial/proprietary license, but one or more
    classes of it are under Modelica License&nbsp;2.<br>
    Note, a &ldquo;type&rdquo; class (e.g., type Angle =
    Real(unit=&ldquo;rad&rdquo;)) can be copied and included unmodified under a
    commercial/proprietary license (for details, see the next question).</p>
    <p><strong>Can I copy a type class or</strong> <u><strong>part</strong></u>
    <strong>of a model, block, function, record, connector class, out of a
    Modelica package (under Modelica License&nbsp;2) and include it modified or
    unmodified in a Modelica package under a</strong>
    <u><strong>commercial/proprietary</strong></u>
    <strong>license?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, according to article&nbsp;2d), since this will in the end usually
    qualify as Derivative Work. The reasoning is the following: A type class or
    part of another class (e.g., an equation, a declaration, part of a class
    description) cannot be utilized &ldquo;by its own&rdquo;. In order to make
    this &ldquo;usable&rdquo;, you have to add additional code in order that
    the class can be utilized. This is therefore usually Derivative Work and
    Derivative Work can be provided under a different license. Note, this only
    holds, if the additional code introduced is sufficient to qualify for
    Derivative Work. Merely, just copying a class and changing, say, one
    character in the documentation of this class would be no Derivative Work
    and therefore the copied code would have to stay under Modelica
    License&nbsp;2.</p>
    <p><strong>Can I copy a class out of a Modelica package (under Modelica
    License&nbsp;2) and include it in</strong> <u><strong>modified</strong></u>
    <strong>form in a</strong> <u><strong>commercial/proprietary</strong></u>
    <strong>Modelica package?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes. If the modification can be seen as a &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo;,
    you can place it under your commercial/proprietary license. If the
    modification does not qualify as &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo; (e.g., bug
    fixes, vendor specific annotations), it must remain under Modelica
    License&nbsp;2. This means that your Modelica package could be under a
    commercial/proprietary license, but one or more parts of it are under
    Modelica License&nbsp;2.</p>
    <p><strong>Can I distribute a &ldquo;save total model&rdquo; under my
    commercial/proprietary license, even if classes under Modelica
    License&nbsp;2 are included?</strong></p>
    <p>Your classes of the &ldquo;save total model&rdquo; can be distributed
    under your commercial/proprietary license, but the classes under Modelica
    License&nbsp;2 must remain under Modelica License&nbsp;2. This means you
    can distribute a &ldquo;save total model&rdquo;, but some parts might be
    under Modelica License&nbsp;2.</p>
    <p><strong>Can I distribute a Modelica package (under Modelica
    License&nbsp;2) in encrypted form?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes. Note, if the encryption does not allow &ldquo;copying&rdquo; of
    classes (in to unencrypted Modelica source code), you have to send the
    Modelica source code of this package to your customer, if he/she wishes it,
    according to article&nbsp;6.</p>
    <p><strong>Can I distribute an executable under my commercial/proprietary
    license, if the model from which the executable is generated uses models
    from a Modelica package under Modelica License&nbsp;2?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, according to article&nbsp;2d), since this is seen as Derivative
    Work. The reasoning is the following: An executable allows the simulation
    of a concrete model, whereas models from a Modelica package (without
    pre-processing, translation, tool run-time library) are not able to be
    simulated without tool support. By the processing of the tool and by its
    run-time libraries, significant new functionality is added (a model can be
    simulated whereas previously it could not be simulated) and functionality
    available in the package is removed (e.g., to build up a new model by
    dragging components of the package is no longer possible with the
    executable).</p>
    <p><strong>Is my modification to a Modelica package (under Modelica
    License&nbsp;2) a Derivative Work?</strong></p>
    <p>It is not possible to give a general answer to it. To be regarded as
    &ldquo;an original work of authorship&rdquo;, a derivative work must be
    different enough from the original or must contain a substantial amount of
    new material. Making minor changes or additions of little substance to a
    preexisting work will not qualify the work as a new version for such
    purposes.</p>
    <h6>Using or Distributing a Modelica <u>Document</u> under the Modelica
    License&nbsp;2</h6>
    <p>This section is devoted especially for the following applications:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p>A Modelica tool extracts information out of a Modelica package
            and presents the result in form of a &ldquo;manual&rdquo; for this
            package in, e.g., html, doc, or pdf format.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The Modelica language specification is a document defining the
            Modelica language. It will be licensed under Modelica
            License&nbsp;2.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Someone writes a book about the Modelica language and/or
            Modelica packages and uses information which is available in the
            Modelica language specification and/or the corresponding Modelica
            package.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Can I sell a manual that was basically derived by extracting
    information automatically from a Modelica package under Modelica
    License&nbsp;2 (e.g., a &ldquo;reference guide&rdquo; of the Modelica
    Standard Library)?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes. Extracting information from a Modelica package, and providing it in
    a human readable, suitable format, like html, doc or pdf format, where the
    content is significantly modified (e.g. tables with interface information
    are constructed from the declarations of the public variables) qualifies as
    Derivative Work and there are no restrictions to charge a fee for
    Derivative Work under alternative&nbsp;2d).</p>
    <p><strong>Can I copy a text passage out of a Modelica document (under
    Modelica License&nbsp;2) and use it</strong>
    <u><strong>unmodified</strong></u> <strong>in my document (e.g. the
    Modelica syntax description in the Modelica Specification)?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes. In case you distribute your document, the copied parts are still
    under Modelica License&nbsp;2 and you are not allowed to charge a license
    fee for this part. You can, of course, charge a fee for the rest of your
    document.</p>
    <p><strong>Can I copy a text passage out of a Modelica document (under
    Modelica License&nbsp;2) and use it in</strong>
    <u><strong>modified</strong></u> <strong>form in my document?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, the creation of Derivative Works is allowed. In case the content is
    significantly modified this qualifies as Derivative Work and there are no
    restrictions to charge a fee for Derivative Work under
    alternative&nbsp;2d).</p>
    <p><strong>Can I sell a printed version of a Modelica document (under
    Modelica License&nbsp;2), e.g., the Modelica Language
    Specification?</strong></p>
    <p>No, if you are not the copyright-holder, since article&nbsp;2c) does not
    allow a selling fee for a (in this case physical) copy. However, mere
    printing and shipping costs may be recovered.</p>
