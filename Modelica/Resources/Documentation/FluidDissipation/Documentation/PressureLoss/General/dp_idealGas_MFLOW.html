<h4><font color="#EF9B13">Calculation</font></h4>
<p>
The geometry parameters of energy devices necessary for the pressure loss calculations are often not exactly known.
Therefore the modelling of the detailed pressure loss calculation has to be simplified.
</p>

The pressure loss <b> dp </b> for the compressible case [Mass flow rate = f(dp)] is determined by (Eq.1):
<pre>
    m_flow = (R_s/Km)^(1/exp)*(rho_m)^(1/exp)*dp^(1/exp)
</pre>

<p>
for the underlying base equation using ideal gas law as follows:
</p>
<pre>
    dp^2 = p_2^2 - p_1^2 = Km*m_flow^exp*(T_2 + T_1)
    dp   = p_2 - p_1     = Km*m_flow^exp*T_m/p_m, Eq.2 with [dp] = Pa, [m_flow] = kg/s
</pre>

<p>
so that the coefficient <b> Km </b> is calculated out of Eq.2:
</p>

</p>
<pre>
    Km = dp*R_s*rho_m / m_flow^exp , [Km] = [Pa^2/{(kg/s)^exp*K}]
</pre>

where the mean density <b> rho_m </b> is calculated according to the ideal gas law out of an arithmetic mean pressure and temperature:
</p>
<pre>
   rho_m = p_m / (R_s*T_m) , p_m = (p_1 + p_2)/2 and T_m = (T_1 + T_2)/2.
</pre>

Furthermore the coefficient <b> Km </b> can be defined more detailled w.r.t. the definition of pressure loss if <b> Km </b> is not given as (e.g., measured) value. Generally pressure loss can be calculated due to local losses <b> Km,LOC </b> or frictional losses <b> Km,FRI </b>.
</p>
<p>
Pressure loss due to local losses gives the following definition of <b> Km </b>:
</p>
<pre>
    dp        = zeta_LOC * (rho_m/2)*velocity^2 is leading to
      Km,LOC  = (8/&Pi^2)*R_s*zeta_LOC/(d_hyd)^4, considering the cross sectional area of pipes.
</pre>

<p>
and pressure loss due to friction is leading to
</p>
<pre>
    dp        = lambda_FRI*L/d_hyd * (rho_m/2)*velocity^2
      Km,FRI  = (8/&Pi^2)*R_s*lambda_FRI*L/(d_hyd)^5, considering the cross sectional area of pipes.

Note that the variables of this function are delivered in SI units so that the coefficient Km shall be given in SI units too.

<b> Compressible case </b> [Mass flow rate = f(dp)]:

<p>
The mass flow rate <b> m_flow </b> for different coefficients <b> Km </b> as parameter is shown in dependence of its pressure loss <b> dp </b> in the figure below.

Note that the verification for <a href="dp_idealGas_DP.html">dp_idealGas_DP</a> is also valid for this inverse calculation due to using the same functions.
