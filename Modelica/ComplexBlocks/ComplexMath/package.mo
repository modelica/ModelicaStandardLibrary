<p>
This package contains basic <strong>mathematical operations</strong>,
such as summation and multiplication, and basic <strong>mathematical
functions</strong>, such as <strong>sqrt</strong> and <strong>sin</strong>, as
input/output blocks. All blocks of this library can be either
connected with continuous blocks or with sampled-data blocks.
