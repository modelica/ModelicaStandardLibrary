This block calculates firing angle from desired voltage, 
choosing either a linear (<code>Lin</code>) relationship or prescribing the first harmonic (<code>H01</code>)  or the root mean square (<code>RMS</code>) . 
Since calculating the firing angle from both the H01 and the RMS involves a nonlinear equation, 
both relationships have been precalculated and are interpolated from a table.
