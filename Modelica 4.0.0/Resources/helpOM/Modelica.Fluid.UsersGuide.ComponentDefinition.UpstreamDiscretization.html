<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>When implementing a Fluid component, the difficult arises that
the value of intensive quantities (such as p, T, ρ) shall be
accessed from the <strong>upstream</strong> volume. For example, if
the fluid flows from volume A to volume B, then the intensive
quantities of volume B have no influence on the fluid between the
two volumes. On the other hand, if the flow direction is reversed,
the intensive quantities of volume A have no influence on the fluid
between the two volumes.</p>
<p>In the Modelica.Fluid library, such a situation is handled with
the following code fragment (from
Interfaces.PartialTwoPortTransport):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
    <strong>annotation</strong>(choicesAllMatching = <strong>true</strong>);

  Interfaces.FluidPort_a port_a(<strong>redeclare package</strong> Medium = Medium);
  Interfaces.FluidPort_b port_b(<strong>redeclare package</strong> Medium = Medium);

  Medium.ThermodynamicState port_a_state_inflow
    "Medium state close to port_a for inflowing mass flow";
  Medium.ThermodynamicState port_b_state_inflow
    "Medium state close to port_b for inflowing mass flow";

<strong>equation</strong>
  // Isenthalpic state transformation (no storage and no loss of energy)
  port_a.h_outflow  = <strong>inStream</strong>(port_b.h_outflow);
  port_b.h_outflow  = <strong>inStream</strong>(port_a.h_outflow);

  port_a.Xi_outflow = <strong>inStream</strong>(port_b.Xi_outflow);
  port_b.Xi_outflow = <strong>inStream</strong>(port_a.Xi_outflow);

  // Mass balance
  port_a.m_flow + port_b.m_flow = 0;

  // Medium states for inflowing medium
  port_a_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_a.p, port_b.h_outflow, port_b.Xi_outflow);
  port_b_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_b.p, port_a.h_outflow, port_a.Xi_outflow);

  // Densities close to the parts when mass flows in to the respective port
  port_a_rho_inflow = Medium.density(port_a_state_inflow);
  port_b_rho_inflow = Medium.density(port_b_state_inflow);

  // Pressure drop correlation (k_ab, k_ba are the loss factors for the two flow
  // directions; e.g., for a circular device: k = 8*zeta/(pi*diameter)^2)^2)
  m_flow = Utilities.regRoot2(port_a.p - port_b.p, dp_small,
                              port_a_rho_inflow/k1, port_b_rho_inflow/k2);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>The medium states for inflowing media can be used to compute
density and dynamic viscosity which in turn can be use to formulate
the pressure drop equation. The standard pressure drop equation</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
dp = port_a - port_b;
m_flow = sqrt(2/(zeta*diameter))*if dp &gt;= 0 then  sqrt(dp)
                                            else -sqrt(-dp)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>cannot be used, since the function has an infinite derivative at
dp=0. Instead the region around zero mass flow rate must be
regularized using one of the regularization functions of
Modelica.Fluid.Utilities. This requires to have density and/or
other medium properties for both flow directions at the same time.
These media properties can be computed from the medium states of
the inflowing fluid at the two ports.</p>
<p>If the above component is connected between two volumes, i.e.,
the independent medium variables in port_a and port_b are usually
states, then port_a.h and port_b.h are either states (i.e., known
quantities in the model) or are computed from states. In either
case they are "known". In such a situation, all equations can be
directly evaluated without any problems. Zero or reversed mass flow
rate does not pose any problems because the medium properties are
always computed for both flow directions and are then used in the
regularization function.</p>
<p>If 3 or more components are connected together, it can be shown
that a system of non-linear algebraic equations appear. The
equations are written by purpose in such a form, that a tool can
select mass flow rates and pressures as iteration variables of this
system. The advantage is that these iteration variables are
continuous and even often differentiable. The alternative to use
the medium states as iteration variables is not good, because T,h,d
are discontinuous for reversing flow direction.</p>
