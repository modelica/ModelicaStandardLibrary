<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This component consists of a <strong>universal</strong> joint at
frame_a, a <strong>revolute</strong> joint at frame_b and a
<strong>spherical</strong> joint which is connected via
<strong>rod1</strong> to the universal and via
<strong>rod2</strong> to the revolute joint, see the default
animation in the following figure (the axes vectors are not part of
the default animation):</p>
<p><img alt="model Joints.Assemblies.JointUSR" src="../../../Modelica%204.0.0/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/Joints/Assemblies/JointUSR.png"/></p>
<p>This joint aggregation has no mass and no inertia and introduces
neither constraints nor potential state variables. It should be
used in kinematic loops whenever possible since the non-linear
system of equations introduced by this joint aggregation is solved
<strong>analytically</strong> (i.e., a solution is always computed,
if a unique solution exists).</p>
<p>The universal joint is defined in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rotation <strong>axis</strong> of revolute joint
<strong>1</strong> is along parameter vector n1_a which is fixed in
frame_a.</li>
<li>The rotation <strong>axis</strong> of revolute joint
<strong>2</strong> is perpendicular to axis 1 and to the line
connecting the universal and the spherical joint (= rod 1).</li>
</ul>
<p>The definition of axis 2 of the universal joint is performed
according to the most often occurring case for the sake of
simplicity. Otherwise, the treatment is much more complicated and
the number of operations is considerably higher, if axis 2 is not
orthogonal to axis 1 and to the connecting rod.</p>
<p>Note, there is a <strong>singularity</strong> when axis 1 and
the connecting rod are parallel to each other. Therefore, if
possible n1_a should be selected in such a way that it is
perpendicular to rRod1_ia in the initial configuration (i.e., the
distance to the singularity is as large as possible).</p>
<p>The rest of this joint aggregation is defined by the following
parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The position of the spherical joint with respect to the
universal joint is defined by vector <strong>rRod1_ia</strong>.
This vector is directed from frame_a to the spherical joint and is
resolved in frame_ia (it is most simple to select frame_ia such
that it is parallel to frame_a in the reference or initial
configuration).</li>
<li>The position of the spherical joint with respect to the
revolute joint is defined by vector <strong>rRod2_ib</strong>. This
vector is directed from the inner frame of the revolute joint
(frame_ib or revolute.frame_a) to the spherical joint and is
resolved in frame_ib (note, that frame_ib and frame_b are parallel
to each other).</li>
<li>The axis of rotation of the revolute joint is defined by axis
vector <strong>n_b</strong>. It is fixed and resolved in
frame_b.</li>
<li>When specifying this joint aggregation with the definitions
above, <strong>two</strong> different
<strong>configurations</strong> are possible. Via parameter
<strong>phi_guess</strong> a guess value for revolute.phi(t0) at
the initial time t0 is given. The configuration is selected that is
closest to phi_guess (|revolute.phi - phi_guess| is minimal).</li>
</ul>
<p>An additional <strong>frame_ia</strong> is present. It is
<strong>fixed</strong> in the rod connecting the universal and the
spherical joint at the origin of <strong>frame_a</strong>. The
placement of frame_ia on the rod is implicitly defined by the
universal joint (frame_a and frame_ia coincide when the angles of
the two revolute joints of the universal joint are zero) and by
parameter vector <strong>rRod1_ia</strong>, the position vector
from the origin of frame_a to the spherical joint, resolved in
frame_<strong>ia</strong>.</p>
<p>An additional <strong>frame_ib</strong> is present. It is
<strong>fixed</strong> in the rod connecting the revolute and the
spherical joint at the side of the revolute joint that is connected
to this rod (= rod2.frame_a = revolute.frame_a).</p>
<p>An additional <strong>frame_im</strong> is present. It is
<strong>fixed</strong> in the rod connecting the revolute and the
spherical joint at the side of the spherical joint that is
connected to this rod (= rod2.frame_b). It is always parallel to
<strong>frame_ib</strong>.</p>
<p>The easiest way to define the parameters of this joint is by
moving the MultiBody system in a <strong>reference
configuration</strong> where <strong>all frames</strong> of all
components are <strong>parallel</strong> to each other
(alternatively, at least frame_a and frame_ia of the JointUSR joint
should be parallel to each other when defining an instance of this
component).</p>
<p>In the public interface of the JointUSR joint, the following
(final) <strong>parameters</strong> are provided:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<strong>parameter</strong> Real rod1Length(unit="m")  "Length of rod 1";
<strong>parameter</strong> Real eRod1_ia[3] "Unit vector along rod 1, resolved in frame_ia";
<strong>parameter</strong> Real e2_ia  [3]  "Unit vector along axis 2, resolved in frame_ia";
</pre></blockquote>
<p>This allows a more convenient definition of data which is
related to rod 1. For example, if a box shall be connected at
frame_ia directing from the origin of frame_a to the middle of rod
1, this might be defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
  Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Joints.Assemblies.JointUSP jointUSR(rRod1_ia={1.2, 1, 0.2});
  Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Visualizers.FixedShape     shape(shapeType       = "box",
                                             lengthDirection = jointUSR.eRod1_ia,
                                             widthDirection  = jointUSR.e2_ia,
                                             length          = jointUSR.rod1Length/2,
                                             width           = jointUSR.rod1Length/10);
<strong>equation</strong>
  <strong>connect</strong>(jointUSP.frame_ia, shape.frame_a);
</pre></blockquote>
