<h4>Overview of the Concept of Magnetic Flux Tubes</h4>
<p>Following below, the concept of magnetic flux tubes is outlined
in short. For a detailed description of flux tube elements, please
have a look at the listed literature. Magnetic flux tubes enable
for modeling of magnetic fields with lumped networks. The figure
below and the following equations illustrate the transition from
the original magnetic field quantities described by
<em>Maxwell</em>'s equations to network elements with a flow
variable and an across variable:</p>

<p>For a region with an approximately homogeneous distribution of
the magnetic field strength <strong>H</strong> and the magnetic
flux density <strong>B</strong> through cross sectional area
<em>A</em> at each length coordinate <em>s</em> (<em>A</em>
perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field lines), a
magnetic reluctance <em>R<sub>m</sub></em> can be defined:</p>

<p>With the definition of the magnetic potential difference
<em>V<sub>m</sub></em> as an across variable and the magnetic flux
<em>Φ</em> as flow variable, a reluctance element
<em>R<sub>m</sub></em> can be defined similar to resistive network
elements in other physical domains. Using <em>Maxwell</em>'s
constitutive equation</p>

<p>the general formula for the calculation of a magnetic reluctance
<em>R<sub>m</sub></em> from its geometric and material properties
is:</p>

<p>For a prismatic or cylindrical volume of length <em>l</em> and
cross sectional area <em>A</em> with the magnetic flux entering and
leaving the region through its end planes, the above equation
simplifies to:</p>

<p>Similar equations can be derived for other geometries. In cases
where a direct integration is not possible, the reluctance can be
calculated on base of average length, average cross sectional area
and volume <em>V</em> respectively:</p>

<p>Network elements for sources of a magnetic potential difference
or magnetomotive force, i.e., coils or permanent magnets can be
formulated as well. The resulting magnetic network models of
actuators reflect the main dimensions of these devices as well as
the normally nonlinear characteristics of their magnetically active
materials.</p>
