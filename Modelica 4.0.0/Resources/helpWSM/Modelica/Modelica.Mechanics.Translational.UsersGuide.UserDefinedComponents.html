In this section some hints are given to define your own
1-dimensional translational components which are compatible with the
elements of this package.
It is convenient to define a new
component by inheritance from one of the following base classes,
which are defined in sublibrary
<a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Interfaces.html">Interfaces</a>:
</p>

  <tr>
    <td><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Interfaces.PartialCompliant.html">PartialCompliant</a>

    <td> Compliant connection of two translational 1-dim. flanges
         (used for force laws such as a spring or a damper).

    <td> Same as &quot;PartialCompliant&quot;, but relative position and relative speed are
         defined as preferred states. Use this partial model if the force law
         needs anyway the relative speed. The advantage is that it is usually better
         to use relative positions between drive train components
         as states, especially, if the position is not limited.

<p>
The difference between these base classes are the auxiliary
variables defined in the model and the relations between
the flange variables already defined in the base class.
For example, in model <strong>PartialCompliant</strong> there is no
support flange, whereas in model
<strong>PartialElementaryTwoFlangesAndSupport2</strong>
there is a support flange.

<p>
The equations of a mechanical component are vector equations, i.e.,
they need to be expressed in a common coordinate system.
Therefore, a <strong>local axis of movement</strong> has to be
defined for a component. All vector quantities, such as cut-forces or
velocities have to be expressed according to this definition.
Examples for such a definition are given in the following figure
for a mass component:
</p>

<div>
<img src="resources/Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.UsersGuide.UserDefinedComponents_info_001.png" alt="driveAxis">
</div>

<p>
As can be seen, all vectors are directed into the direction
of the movement axis. The positions in the flanges are defined
correspondingly.
</p>
<p>
On first view, one may assume that the selected local
coordinate system has an influence on the usage of the
component. But this is not the case, as shown in the next figure:
</p>

<div>
<img src="resources/Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.UsersGuide.UserDefinedComponents_info_002.png" alt="masses">
</div>

<p>
In the figure, the <strong>local</strong> axes of translation of the components
are shown. The connection of two masses in the left and in the
right part of the figure are completely equivalent, i.e., the right
part is just a different drawing of the left part. This is due to the
fact, that by a connection, the two local coordinate systems are
made identical and the (automatically) generated connection equations
(= positions are identical, cut-forces sum-up to zero) are also
expressed in this common coordinate system. Therefore, even if in
the left figure it seems to be that the velocity vector of
<code>mass2</code> goes from right to left, in reality it goes from
left to right as shown in the right part of the figure, where the
local coordinate systems are drawn such that they are aligned.
Note, that the simple rule stated in section
<a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.UsersGuide.SignConventions.html">Sign conventions</a>
also determines that
the velocity of <code>mass2</code> in the left part of the
figure is directed from left to right.
</p>
<p>
To summarize, the local coordinate system selected for a component
is just necessary in order that the equations of this component
are expressed correctly. The selection of the coordinate system
is arbitrary and has no influence on the usage of the component.
Especially, the actual direction of, e.g., a cut-force is most
easily determined by the rule of section
<a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.UsersGuide.SignConventions.html">Sign conventions</a>.
A more strict determination
by aligning coordinate systems and then using the vector direction
of the local coordinate systems, often requires a re-drawing of the
diagram and is therefore less convenient to use.
