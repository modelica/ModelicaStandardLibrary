<p>
One important special case for a pressure loss is the friction at the
wall of a pipe under the assumption of quasi steady state flow (i.e., the
mass flow rate varies only slowly). In this section it is explained how this case is
handled in the Modelica.Fluid library for pipes with
<strong>nonuniform roughness</strong>, including the smooth pipe
as a special case (see
<a href="Modelica.Fluid.Pipes.BaseClasses.WallFriction.html">Pipes.BaseClasses.WallFriction</a>).
The treatment is non-standard in order to get a
numerically well-posed description.
</p>

<p>
For pipes with circular cross section the pressure drop is computed as:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
   dp = &lambda;(Re,&Delta;)*(L/D)*&rho;*v*|v|/2
      = &lambda;(Re,&Delta;)*8*L/(&pi;^2*D^5*&rho;)*m_flow*|m_flow|
      = &lambda;2(Re,&Delta;)*k2*sign(m_flow);

with
   Re     = |v|*D*&rho;/&mu;
          = |m_flow|*4/(&pi;*D*&mu;)
   m_flow = A*v*&rho;
   A      = &pi;*(D/2)^2
   &lambda;2     = &lambda;*Re^2
   k2     = L*&mu;^2/(2*D^3*&rho;)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
where
</p>
<ul>
<li> L is the length of the pipe.</li>
<li> D is the diameter of the pipe. If the pipe has not a
     circular cross section, D = 4*A/P, where A is the cross section
     area and P is the wetted perimeter.</li>
<li> &lambda; = &lambda;(Re,&Delta;) is the "usual" wall friction coefficient.</li>
<li> &lambda;2 = &lambda;*Re^2 is the used friction coefficient to get a numerically
     well-posed formulation.</li>
<li> Re = |v|*D*&rho;/&mu; is the Reynolds number.</li>
<li> &Delta; = &delta;/D is the relative roughness where
     "&delta;" is
     the absolute "roughness", i.e., the averaged height of asperities in the pipe
     (&delta; may change over time due to growth of surface asperities during
      service, see <em>[Idelchik 1994, p. 85, Tables 2-1, 2-2])</em>.</li>
<li> &rho; is the upstream density.</li>
<li> &mu; is the upstream dynamic viscosity.</li>
<li> v is the mean velocity.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The first form with &lambda; is used and presented in textbooks,
see "blue" curve in the next figure:
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
This form is not suited for a simulation program since
&lambda; = 64/Re if Re &lt; 2000, i.e., a division by zero occurs for
zero mass flow rate because Re = 0 in this case.
More useful for a simulation model is the friction coefficient
&lambda;2 = &lambda;*Re^2, because &lambda;2 = 64*Re if Re &lt; 2000 and
therefore no problems for zero mass flow rate occur.
The characteristic of &lambda;2 is shown in the next figure and is
used in Modelica.Fluid:
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
The pressure loss characteristic is divided into three regions:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Region 1</strong>:
     For <strong>Re &le; 2000</strong>, the flow is <strong>laminar</strong> and the exact solution of the
     3-dim. Navier-Stokes equations (momentum and mass balance) is used under the
     assumptions of steady flow, constant pressure gradient and constant
     density and viscosity (= Hagen-Poiseuille flow) leading to &lambda;2 = 64*Re.
     Therefore:
     <blockquote><pre>
dp = 128*&mu;*L/(&pi;*D^4*&rho;)*m_flow
     </pre></blockquote><br>&nbsp;
</li>

<li> <strong>Region 3</strong>:
     For <strong>Re &ge; 4000</strong>, the flow is <strong>turbulent</strong>.
     Depending on the calculation direction (see "inverse formulation"
     below) either of two explicit equations are used. If the pressure drop dp
     is assumed to be known, &lambda;2 = |dp|/k2. The
     Colebrook-White equation
     <em>[Colebrook 1939; Idelchik 1994, p. 83, eq. (2-9)]</em>:
     <blockquote><pre>1/sqrt(&lambda;) = -2*lg( 2.51/(Re*sqrt(&lambda;)) + 0.27*&Delta;)</pre></blockquote>
     gives an implicit relationship between Re and &lambda;.
     Inserting &lambda;2 = &lambda;*Re^2 allows to solve this equation analytically
     for Re: <blockquote><pre>Re = -2*sqrt(&lambda;2)*lg(2.51/sqrt(&lambda;2) + 0.27*&Delta;)</pre></blockquote>
     Finally, the mass flow rate m_flow is computed from Re via
     m_flow = Re*&pi;*D*&mu;/4*sign(dp).
     These are the <strong>red</strong> curves in the diagrams above.<br>
     If the mass flow rate is assumed known (and therefore implicitly
     also the Reynolds number), then &lambda;2 is computed by an
     approximation of the inverse of the Colebrook-White equation
     <em>[Swamee and Jain 1976;
     Miller 1990, p. 191, eq.(8.4)]</em> adapted to &lambda;2:
     <blockquote><pre>
&lambda;2 = 0.25*(Re/lg(&Delta;/3.7 + 5.74/Re^0.9))^2
     </pre></blockquote>
     The pressure drop is then computed as dp = k2*&lambda;2*sign(m_flow).
     These are the <strong>blue</strong> curves in the diagrams above.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li> <strong>Region 2</strong>:
     For <strong>2000 &le; Re &le; 4000</strong> there is a transition region between laminar
     and turbulent flow. The value of &lambda;2 depends on more factors as just
     the Reynolds number and the relative roughness, therefore only crude
     approximations are possible in this area.<br>
     The deviation from the laminar region depends on the
     relative roughness. A laminar flow at Re=2000 is only reached for smooth pipes.
     The deviation Reynolds number Re1 is computed according to
     <em>[Samoilenko 1968; Idelchik 1994, p. 81, sect. 2.1.21]</em> as:
     <blockquote><pre>Re1 = 745*e^(if &Delta; &le; 0.0065 then 1 else 0.0065/&Delta;)</pre></blockquote>
     These are the <strong>blue</strong> curves in the diagrams above.<br>
     Between Re1=Re1(&delta;/D) and Re2=4000,
     &lambda;2 is approximated by a cubic
     polynomial in the "lg(&lambda;2) - lg(Re)" chart (see figures above) such that the
     first derivative is continuous at these two points. In order to avoid
     the solution of non-linear equations, two different cubic polynomials are used
     for the direct and the inverse formulation. This leads to some discrepancies
     in &lambda;2 (= differences between the red and the blue curves).
     This is acceptable, because the transition region is anyway not
     precisely known since the actual friction coefficient depends on
     additional factors and since the operating points are usually
     not in this region.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The absolute roughness &delta; has usually to
be estimated. In <em>[Idelchik 1994, pp. 105-109,
Table 2-5; Miller 1990, p. 190, Table 8-1]</em> many examples are given.

<p>
The equations above are valid for incompressible flow.
They can also be applied for <strong>compressible</strong> flow up to about <strong>Ma = 0.6</strong>
(Ma is the Mach number) with a maximum error in &lambda; of about 3 %.
The effect of gas compressibility in a wide region can be taken into
account by the following formula derived by Voronin
<em>[Voronin 1959; Idelchik 1994, p. 97, sect. 2.1.81]</em>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
&lambda;_comp = &lambda;*(1 + (&kappa;-1)/2 * Ma^2)^(-0.47)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
where &kappa; is the isentropic coefficient
(for ideal gases, &kappa; is the ratio of specific heat capacities cp/cv).
An appreciable decrease in the coefficient "&lambda;_comp" is observed
only in a narrow transonic region and also at supersonic flow velocities
by about 15% <em>[Idelchik 1994, p. 97, sect. 2.1.81]</em>.
This effect is not yet included in Modelica.Fluid.
Another restriction is that the pressure drop model is valid
only for steady state or slowly changing mass flow rate.
For large fluid acceleration, the pressure drop depends additionally
on the frequency of the changing mass flow rate.
</p>

<h4>Inverse formulation</h4>

<p>
In the "Advanced menu" it is possible via parameter
"from_dp" to define in which form the
pressure drop equation is actually evaluated (<strong>default</strong> is from_dp = <strong>true</strong>):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
from_dp = <strong>true</strong>:   m_flow = f1(dp)
        = <strong>false</strong>:  dp     = f2(m_flow)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
"from_dp" can be useful to avoid nonlinear systems of equations
in cases where the inverse pressure loss function is needed.
</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>
A detailed pressure drop model for pipe wall friction is
provided in the form m_flow = f1(dp, &Delta;) or
dp = f2(m_flow, &Delta;).
These functions are continuous and differentiable,
are provided in an explicit form without solving non-linear equations,
and do behave well also at small mass flow rates. This pressure drop
model can be used stand-alone in a static momentum balance and in
a dynamic momentum balance as the friction pressure drop term.
It is valid for incompressible and compressible flow up to a Mach number of 0.6.
