<p>
A medium model of Modelica.Media is essentially a <strong>package</strong>
that contains the following definitions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Definition of <strong>constants</strong>, such as the medium name.</li>
<li>
A <strong>model</strong> in the package that contains the 3 basic
thermodynamic equations that relate the 5+nXi primary medium variables.</li>
<li><strong>Optional functions</strong> to compute medium properties that are
only needed in certain circumstances, such as dynamic viscosity. These optional
functions need not be provided by every medium model.</li>
<li>
<strong>Type</strong> definitions, which are adapted to the particular
medium. For example, a type <strong>Temperature</strong> is defined where the attributes
<strong>min</strong>
and <strong>max</strong> define the validity region of the medium, and a suitable default
start value is given. In a device model, it is advisable to use these type
definitions, e.g., for parameters, in order that medium limits are checked as
early as possible, and that iteration variables of non-linear
systems of equations get reasonable start values.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note, although we use the term <strong>medium model</strong>, it
is actually a Modelica <strong>package</strong> that contains all the constants and
definitions required for a complete <strong>medium model</strong>. The basic interface to a
medium is defined by Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium that has the
following structure:</p>

                               nominal = 1.e5,
                               start   = 1.e5);

<strong>end</strong> PartialMedium;
</pre>
<p>
We will discuss all parts of this package in the
following paragraphs. An actual medium model should extend from PartialMedium
and has to provide implementations of the various parts.
</p>

<p>
Some of the constants at the beginning of the package do not have a value yet
(this is valid in Modelica), but a value has to be provided when extending from
package PartialMedium. A given value can be modified until the model is
translated or the <strong>final</strong> prefix is set.
The reason to use constants instead of parameters in the model BaseProperties
is that some of these constants are used in a context where parameters
are not allowed. For example, in connector definitions the
number of independent mass fractions nXi is used as dimension
of a vector Xi. When defining the
connector, only <em>constants</em> in packages can be accessed, but not
<em>parameters</em> in a model, because a connector cannot contain an instance
of BaseProperties.
</p>

<p>The record BasePropertiesRecord contains the variables
primarily used in balance equations. Three equations for these variables have
to be provided by every medium in model BaseProperties, plus two equations
for the gas constant and the molar mass.
</p>

<p>Optional medium properties are defined by functions, such as the function
dynamicViscosity (see code Section above) to compute the dynamic viscosity.
The argument of those functions is the ThermodynamicState record, defined
in BaseProperties, which contains the minimum number of thermodynamic variables
needed as an input to compute all the optional properties.
This construction simplifies the usage
considerably as demonstrated in the following code fragment:
</p>

<pre>
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
  Medium.BaseProperties   medium;
  Medium.DynamicViscosity eta;
  ...
  U   = m*medium.u; //Internal energy
  eta = Medium.dynamicViscosity(medium.state);
</pre>

<p>Medium is the medium package that satisfies the
requirements of a PartialMedium (when using the model above, a value for
Medium has to be provided by a redeclaration). The medium component is an
instance of the model Medium.BaseProperties and contains the core medium
equations. Variables in this model can be accessed just by dot-notation, such
as medium.u or medium.T. If an optional medium variable has to be computed, the
corresponding function from the actual Medium package is called, such as
Medium.dynamicViscosity. The medium.state vector can be given as input argument
to this function, and its fields are kept consistent to those of BaseProperties
by suitable equations, contained in BaseProperties itself (see above).
</p>

<p>If a medium model does not provide implementations of all
optional functions and one of these functions is called in a model, an error
occurs during translation since the optional functions which have not been
redeclared have the <em>partial</em> attribute. For example, if function
dynamicViscosity is not provided in the medium model when it is used, only
simple pressure drop loss models without a reference to the viscosity can be
used and not the sophisticated ones.
</p>

<p>At the bottom of the PartialMedium package type declarations
are present, that are used in all other parts of the PartialMedium package and
that should be used in all models and connectors where a medium model is
accessed. The reason is that minimum, maximum, nominal, and start
values are defined and these values can be adapted to the particular medium at
hand. For example, the nominal value of AbsolutePressure is 10<sup>5</sup>
Pa. If a simple model of water steam is used that is only valid above 100 &deg;C,
then the minimum value in the Temperature type should be set to this value. The
minimum and maximum values are also important for parameters in order to get an
early message if data outside of the validity region is given. The nominal
attribute is important as a scaling value if the variable is used as a state in
a differential equation or as an iteration variable in a non-linear system of
equations. The start attribute can be very useful to provide a meaningful
default start or guess value if the variable is used, e.g., as iteration
variable in a non-linear system of equations. Note, that all these attributes
can be set specifically for a medium in the following way:
</p>

<pre>
<strong>package</strong> MyMedium
  <strong>extends</strong> Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium(
     ...
     Temperature(min=373));
<strong>end</strong> MyMedium;
</pre>

<p>
The type PartialMedium.MassFlowRate is defined as
</p>

<pre>
<strong>type</strong> MassFlowRate = Modelica.SIunits.MassFlowRate
     (quantity = "MassFlowRate." + mediumName);
</pre>

<p>Note that the constant mediumName, that has to be
defined in every medium model, is used in the quantity attribute. For example,
if mediumName = SimpleLiquidWater, then the quantity attribute has the value
MassFlowRate.SimpleLiquidWater. This type should be used in a connector
definition of a fluid library:
</p>

<pre>
<strong>connector</strong> FluidPort
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.MassFlowRate m_flow;
  ...
<strong>end</strong> FluidPort;
</pre>

<p>In the model where this connector is used, the actual
Medium has to be defined. Connectors can only be connected together, if the
corresponding attributes are either not defined or have identical values. Since
mediumName is part of the quantity attribute of MassFlowRate, it is not
possible to connect connectors with different media models together.</p>

<p>
Let's now walk through the definition of a new medium model. Please refer to
<a href="Modelica_Media_Interfaces_TemplateMedium.html#Modelica.Media.Interfaces.TemplateMedium"
>
Modelica.Media.Interfaces.TemplateMedium</a> to obtain a template of the new
medium model code. For the moment being, consider a single-substance medium
model.
</p>
<p>
The new medium model is obtained by extending Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium, and
setting the following package constants:
</p>
<ul>
<li>mediumName is a String containing the name of the medium.</li>
<li>substanceNames is a vector of strings containing the names of the substances
    that make up the medium. In this case, it will contain only mediumName.</li>
<li>singleState can be set to true if u and d in BaseProperties do not depend
    on pressure. In other words, density does not depend on pressure
    (incompressible fluid), and it is assumed that also u does not depend on
    pressure. This setting can be useful for fluids having high density and
    low compressibility (e.g., liquids at moderate pressure); fast states
    resulting from the low compressibility effects are automatically avoided.</li>
<li>reducedX = true for single-substance media, which do not need mass
    fractions at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It is also possible to change the default min, max, nominal, and start
attributes of Medium-defined types (see TemplateMedium).</p>
<p>
All other package constants, such as nX, nXi, nS, are automatically set
by the declarations of the base package Interfaces.PartialMedium.</p>
<p>
The second step is to provide an implementation to the BaseProperties model,
partially defined in the base class Interfaces.PartialMedium. In the case of
single-substance media, two independent state variables must be selected among
p, T, d, u, h, and three equations must be written to provide the values of
the remaining variables. Two equations must then be added to compute the molar
mass MM and the gas constant R.</p>
<p>
The third step is to consider the optional functions that are going to be
implemented, among the partial functions defined by the base class PartialMedium.
A minimal set of state variables that could be provided as an input to
<em>all</em> those functions must be selected, and included in the redeclaration
of the ThermodynamicState record. Subsequently, equations must be added to
BaseProperties in order that the instance of that record inside BaseProperties
(named "state") is kept updated. For example, assume that all additional
properties can be computed as a function of p and T. Then, ThermodynamicState
should be redeclared as follows:</p>
<pre>
  <strong>redeclare replaceable record</strong> ThermodynamicState
    AbsolutePressure p "Absolute pressure of medium";
    Temperature T "Temperature of medium";
  <strong>end</strong> ThermodynamicState;
</pre>
<p>
and the following equations should be added to BaseProperties:
</p>
<pre>
  state.p = p;
  state.T = T;
</pre>
<p>
The additional functions can now be implemented by redeclaring the functions
defined in the base class and adding their algorithms, e.g.:
</p>
<pre>
    <strong>redeclare function extends</strong> dynamicViscosity "Return dynamic viscosity"
    <strong>algorithm</strong>
      eta := 10 - state.T*0.3 + state.p*0.2;
    <strong>end</strong> dynamicViscosity;
</pre>

<p>
When writing the model of a multiple-substance medium, a fundamental issue
concerns how to consider the mass fractions of the fluid. If there are nS
substances, there are also nS mass fractions; however, one of them is redundant,
as sum(X) = 1. Therefore there are basically two options, concerning the number
of independent mass fractions nXi:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <em>Reduced-state models</em>: reducedX = <strong>true</strong> and nXi = nS - 1. In this
case, the number of independent mass fractions nXi is the minimum possible.
The full state vector X is provided by equations declared in the base class
Interfaces.PartialMedium.BaseProperties: the first nXi elements are equal to
Xi, and the last one is 1 - sum(Xi).</li>
<li> <em>Full-state models</em>: reducedX = <strong>false</strong> and nXi = nS. In this case,
Xi = X, i.e., all the elements of the composition vector are considered as
independent variables, and the constraint sum(X) = 1 is never written explicitly.
Although this kind of model is heavier, as it provides one extra state variable,
it can be less prone to numerical and/or symbolic problems, which can be
caused by that constraint.</li>
<li> <em>Fixed-composition models</em>: fixedX = <strong>true</strong> and nXi = 0. In this case X = reference_X, i.e., all the elements of the composition vector are fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p> The medium implementer can declare the value reducedX as <strong>final</strong>. In
this way only one implementation must be given. For instance,
Modelica.Media.IdealGases models declare <strong>final</strong> reducedX = <strong>false</strong>, so that the
implementation can always assume nXi = nX. The same is true for Air.MoistAir,
which declares <strong>final</strong> reducedX = <strong>true</strong>, and always assumes nXi = nX - 1 = 1.</p>
<p>It is also possible to leave reducedX modifiable. In this case, the
BaseProperties model and all additional functions should check for the actual
value of reducedX, and provide the corresponding implementation.</p>

<p>If fixedX is left modifiable, then the implementation should also handle the
case fixedX = true properly.</p>
<p>Fluid connectors should always use composition vectors of size Xi, such as
in the Modelica_Fluid library:</p>

<p>
If pressure p and specific enthalpy h are <strong>not</strong> used as
independent medium variables, the specific enthalpy should
be computed by a Modelica function that has as input arguments
only the independent medium variables. It should <strong>not</strong> be
computed by an equation. For example, if p and T are used
as independent medium variables, a function h_pT(p,T) should
be defined that is called to compute h:
</p>

<pre>
    h = h_pT(p,T);
</pre>

<p>
The reason for this rule requires a longer explanation.
In short, if h is not a computed by a Modelica function and
this function is non-linear in the independent medium variables,
then non-linear systems of equations will occur at
every connection point, if the FluidPort connectors from the
Modelica_Fluid library are used (these are the same as in
Modelica.Media.Examples.Utilities.FluidPort).
Only, if the above rule is fulfilled, a tool is able to
remove these non-linear system of equations in most cases.
</p>

<p>
The basic idea of the FluidPort connector is that 2 or more
components can be connected together at a point and that
automatically the mass and energy balance is fulfilled
in the connection point, i.e., the ideal mixing equations
are generated. Note, the momentum balance is only correct for
straight line connections. If "ideal mixing" is not sufficient,
a special component to define the mixing equations must be introduced.
</p>

<p>
The mass and momentum balance equations in a component are
derived from the partial differential equations along the
flow direction of a pipe:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Media/UsersGuide/BalanceEquations1.png">
</p>

<p>
Note, F<sub>F</sub> is the fanning friction factor.
The energy balance can be given in different forms.
Usually, it is given as:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Media/UsersGuide/EnergyBalance1.png">
</p>

<p>
This form describes the change of the internal energy, kinetic
energy and potential energy of a volume as function of the
in and out flowing fluid. Multiplying the momentum balance
with the flow velocity v and subtracting it from the energy
balance above, results in the following alternative form
of the energy balance:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Media/UsersGuide/EnergyBalance2.png">
</p>

<p>
This form has the advantage that the kinetic and potential
energy is no longer part of the energy balance and therefore
the energy balance is substantially simpler (e.g., additional non-linear
systems of equations occur in the first form since the velocity
is present in the energy balance; in the second form this is not
the case and it is still valid also for high speeds).
</p>

<p>
Assume now that the second form of the energy balance above
is used in all components and that the following FluidPort connector
is used in all components:
</p>

<pre>
<strong>connector</strong> FluidPort
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
  Medium.AbsolutePressure      p;
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.MassFlowRate     m_flow;

  Medium.SpecificEnthalpy      h;
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.EnthalpyFlowRate H_flow;

  Medium.MassFraction          Xi    [Medium.nXi];
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.MassFlowRate     mX_flow[Medium.nXi];
<strong>end</strong> FluidPort;
</pre>

<p>
As an example, assume that 3 components
are connected together and that the medium is a single substance
fluid. This will result in the following
connection equations:
</p>

<pre>
    p1=p2=p3;
    h1=h2=h3;
    0 = m_flow1 + m_flow2 + m_flow3;
    0 = H_flow1 + H_flow2 + H_flow3;
</pre>

<p>
These are the mass balance and the
energy balance (form 2) of an infinitesimal volume
in the connection point under the assumption that no
mass or energy is stored in this volume. In other words,
the connection equations are the equations that describe
ideal mixing. Under the assumption that the velocity
vectors of the 3 flows are identical (especially, they are
parallel), also the momentum balance is fulfilled:
</p>

<pre>
   0 = m_flow1*v1 + m_flow2*v2 + m_flow3*v3;
     = v*(m_flow1 + m_flow2 + m_flow3);
     = 0;
</pre>

<p>
With the above connector it is therefore possible to
connect components together in a nearly arbitrary fashion,
because every connection fulfills automatically the
balance equations. This approach has, however, one drawback:
If two components are connected together, then the medium
variables on both sides of the connector are identical.
However, due to the connector, only the two equations
</p>

<pre>
   p1 = p2;
   h1 = h2;
</pre>

<p>
are present. Assume, that p,T are the independent medium variables
and that the medium properties are computed at one side of the
connections. This means, the following equations are basically
present:
</p>

<pre>
    h1 = h(p1,T1);
    h2 = h(p2,T2);
    p1 = p2;
    h1 = h2;
</pre>

<p>
These equations can be solved in the following way:
</p>

<pre>
    h1 := h(p1,T1)
    p2 := p1;
    h2 := h1;
    0  := h2 - h(p2,T2);   // non-linear system of equations for T2
</pre>

<p>
This means that T2 is computed by solving a non-linear system
of equations. If h1 and h2 are provided as Modelica functions,
a Modelica translator can replace
this non-linear system of equations by the equation:
</p>

<pre>
   T2 := T1;
</pre>

<p>
because after alias substitution there are two function calls
</p>

<pre>
    h1 := h(p1,T1);
    h1 := h(p1,T2);
</pre>

<p>
Since the left hand side of the function call and the first
argument are the same, the second arguments T1 and T2 must also be
identical and therefore T2 := T1. This type of analysis seems
to be only possible, if the specific enthalpy is defined as a function
of the independent medium variables.

>Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumDefinition</a>.StaticStateSelection</h2>

<p>
Without pre-caution when implementing a medium model,
it is very easy that non-linear algebraic
systems of equations occur when using the medium model.
In this section it is explained how to avoid non-linear
systems of equations that result from unnecessary
dynamic state selections.
</p>
<p>
A medium model should be implemented in such a way that
a tool is able to select states of a medium in a balance volume
statically (during translation). This is only possible if the
medium equations are written in a specific way. Otherwise,
a tool has to dynamically select states during simulation.
Since medium equations are usually non-linear, this means that
non-linear algebraic systems of equations would occur in every
balance volume.
</p>
<p>
It is assumed that medium equations in a balance volume
are defined in the following way:
</p>
<pre>
    <strong>package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
    Medium.BaseProperties medium;
  <strong>equation</strong>
     // mass balance
       <strong>der</strong>(M)  = port_a.m_flow + port_b.m_flow;
       <strong>der</strong>(MX) = port_a_mX_flow + port_b_mX_flow;
             M = V*medium.d;
            MX = M*medium.X;

     // Energy balance
     U = M*medium.u;
     <strong>der</strong>(U) = port_a.H_flow+port_b.H_flow;
</pre>
<p>
<strong>Single Substance Media</strong>
</p>
<p>
A medium consisting of a single substance
has to define two of "p,T,d,u,h" with
stateSelect=StateSelect.prefer if BaseProperties.preferredMediumstates = <strong>true</strong>
and has to provide the other three variables as function of these
states. This results in:
</p>
<ul>
<li> static state selection (no dynamic choices).</li>
<li> a linear system of equations in the two
     state derivatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Example for a single substance medium</strong>
</p>
<p>
p, T are preferred states (i.e., StateSelect.prefer is set)
and there are three equations written in the form:
</p>
<pre>
   d = fd(p,T)
   u = fu(p,T)
   h = fh(p,T)
</pre>
<p>
Index reduction leads to the equations:
</p>
<pre>
   <strong>der</strong>(M) = V*<strong>der</strong>(d)
   <strong>der</strong>(U) = <strong>der</strong>(M)*u + M*<strong>der</strong>(u)
   <strong>der</strong>(d) = <strong>der</strong>(fd,p)*<strong>der</strong>(p) + <strong>der</strong>(fd,T)*<strong>der</strong>(T)
   <strong>der</strong>(u) = <strong>der</strong>(fu,p)*<strong>der</strong>(p) + <strong>der</strong>(fu,T)*<strong>der</strong>(T)
</pre>
<p>
Note, that <strong>der</strong>(y,x) is the partial derivative of y with respect to x
and that this operator will be introduced in a future version
of the Modelica language.
The above equations imply, that if p,T are provided from the
integrator as states, all functions, such as fd(p,T)
or <strong>der</strong>(fd,p) can be evaluated as function of the states.
The overall system results in a linear system
of equations in <strong>der</strong>(p) and <strong>der</strong>(T) after eliminating
<strong>der</strong>(M), <strong>der</strong>(U), <strong>der</strong>(d), <strong>der</strong>(u) via tearing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Counter Example for a single substance medium</strong>
</p>
<p>
An ideal gas with one substance is written in the form
</p>
<pre>
  <strong>redeclare model extends</strong> BaseProperties(
     T(stateSelect=if preferredMediumStates then StateSelect.prefer else StateSelect.default),
     p(stateSelect=if preferredMediumStates then StateSelect.prefer else StateSelect.default)
  <strong>equation</strong>
     h = h(T);
     u = h - R*T;
     p = d*R*T;
      ...
  <strong>end</strong> BaseProperties;
</pre>
<p>
If p, T are preferred states, these equations are <strong>not</strong>
written in the recommended form, because d is not a
function of p and T. If p,T would be states, it would be
necessary to solve for the density:
</p>
<pre>
   d = p/(R*T)
</pre>
<p>
If T or R are zero, this results in a division by zero.
A tool does not know that R or T cannot become zero.
Therefore, a tool must assume that p, T <strong>cannot</strong> always be
selected as states and has to either use another static
state selection or use dynamic state selection. The only
other choice for static state selection is d,T, because
h,u,p are given as functions of d,T.
However, as potential states only variables appearing differentiated and variables
declared with StateSelect.prefer or StateSelect.always
are used. Since "d" does not appear differentiated and has
StateSelect.default, it cannot be selected as a state.
As a result, the tool has to select states dynamically
during simulation. Since the equations above are non-linear
and they are utilized in the dynamic state
selection, a non-linear system of equations is present
in every balance volume.
</p>
<p>
To summarize, for single substance ideal gas media there
are the following two possibilities to get static
state selection and linear systems of equations:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Use p,T as preferred states and write the equation
     for d in the form: d = p/(T*R)</li>
<li> Use d,T as preferred states and write the equation
     for p in the form: p = d*T*R</li>
</ol>
<p>
All other settings (other/no preferred states etc.) lead
to dynamic state selection and non-linear systems of
equations for a balance volume.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Multiple Substance Media</strong>
</p>
<p>
A medium consisting of multiple substance
has to define two of "p,T,d,u,h" as well
as the mass fractions Xi with
stateSelect=StateSelect.prefer (if BaseProperties.preferredMediumStates = <strong>true</strong>)
and has to provide
the other three variables as functions of these
states. Only then, static selection is possible
for a tool.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Example for a multiple substance medium:</strong>
</p>
<p>
p, T and Xi are defined as preferred states and
the equations are written in the form:
</p>
<pre>
   d = fp(p,T,Xi);
   u = fu(p,T,Xi);
   h = fh(p,T,Xi);
</pre>
<p>
Since the balance equations are written in the form:
</p>
<pre>
              M = V*medium.d;
            MXi = M*medium.Xi;
</pre>
<p>
The variables M and MXi appearing differentiated in the
balance equations are provided as functions of d and Xi
and since d is given as a function of p, T and Xi, it
is possible to compute M and MXi directly from the desired
states. This means that static state selection is possible.

<p>
After implementation of a new medium model, it should
be tested. A basic test is already provided with model
Modelica.Media.Examples.Utilities.PartialTestModel
which might be used in the following way:
</p>

<pre>
  <strong>model</strong> TestOfMyMedium
     <strong>extends</strong> Modelica.Media.Examples.Utilities.PartialTestModel(
              <strong>redeclare package</strong> Medium = MyMedium);
  <strong>end</strong> TestOfMyMedium;
</pre>

<p>
It might be necessary to adapt or change initial values
depending on the validity range of the medium.
The model above should translate and simulate.
If the medium model is written according to the
suggestions given in the previous sections (and the Modelica
translator has appropriate algorithms implemented),
there should be only static state selection everywhere
and no non-linear system of equations, provided h is an independent
medium variable or is only a function of T. If h is a function
of, say h=h(p,T), one non-linear system of equations occurs that
cannot be avoided.
</p>

<p>
The test model above can be used to test the most basic
properties. Of course, more tests should be performed.
