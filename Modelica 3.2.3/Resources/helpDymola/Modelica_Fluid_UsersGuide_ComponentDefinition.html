<p>
In this section the design of the fluid connectors is
explained.
</p>
<p>
Fluid connectors represent the points in a device (e.g., the
flanges) through which a fluid can flow into or out of the component, carrying its
thermodynamic properties; these flanges are assumed to be fixed in space.
</p>
<p>
A major design goal is that components can be arbitrarily
connected and that the important balance equations are automatically
fulfilled when 2 or more components are connected together at
one point as shown in the next figure:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Fluid/UsersGuide/MixingConnections.png"
     alt="MixingConnections.png">
</p>

<p>
In such a case the balance equations define <strong>ideal mixing</strong>,
i.e., the upstream discretization scheme of each component uses
values that result from ideal mixing in
an infinitely small time period. If more realistic modelling
is desired that takes into account mixing losses, an explicit
model has to be used in the connection point.
</p>
<h4>Single substance media</h4>
<p>
For a single substance medium, the connector definition in
Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort reduces to
</p>
<pre>
  <strong>connector</strong> FluidPort
     <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
              "Medium model of the fluid";
     <strong>flow</strong> Medium.MassFlowRate m_flow;
              "Mass flow rate from the connection point into the component";
     Medium.AbsolutePressure p
              "Thermodynamic pressure in the connection point";
     <strong>stream</strong> Medium.SpecificEnthalpy h_outflow
               "Specific thermodynamic enthalpy close to the connection point if m_flow &lt; 0";
  <strong>end</strong> FluidPort;
</pre>
<p>
The first statement defines the Medium flowing through the connector.
In a medium, medium specific types such as "Medium.AbsolutePressure"
are defined that contain medium specific values for the min, max and
nominal attributes. Furthermore, Medium.MassFlowRate is defined as:
</p>
<pre>
   <strong>type</strong> MassFlowRate =
      Modelica.SIunits.MassFlowRate(quantity="MassFlowRate." + mediumName);
</pre>
<p>
With the current library design, it is necessary to explicitly select the medium
model for each component in a circuit. This model is then propagated to the ports,
and a Modelica translator will check that the quantity and unit attributes
of connected interfaces are identical. Therefore, an error occurs,
if connected FluidPorts do not have a medium with the same medium name.
In the future, automatic propagation of fluid models through the ports will be
introduced, but this still not possible with Modelica 3.0.
</p>
<p>
The thermodynamic pressure is an <em>effort</em> variable, which means that the connection
of two or more ports states that the port pressures are the same.
</p>
<p>
The mass flow rate is a <em>flow</em> variable, which means that the connection of two or
more ports states that the sum of all flow rates is zero.
</p>
<p>
The last variable is a <em>stream</em> variable, i.e., a specific quantity carried by the
flow variable. The quantity on the connector always
corresponds to the value close to the connection point, assuming that the fluid is
flowing out of the connector, regardless of the actual direction of the flow. This helps
avoiding singularities when the mass flow goes through zero. The stream properties for the
other flow direction can be inquired with the built-in operator inStream(..), while the
value of the stream variable corresponding to the actual flow direction can be inquired
through the built-in operator actualStream(..).
</p>
<p>
The actual equations corresponding to these operators are introduced and solved automatically
by the tool. In principle, they correspond to the balance equation
sum(flow_variable) = 0 and sum(flow_variable*stream_variable_at_connection) = 0 applied to the set of connected ports. In this case the first equation is the mass balance sum(m_flow) = 0, and the second is the energy balance at the connection point sum(m_flow*h_connection) = 0.
</p>
<p>
In the simpler case of a one-to-one connections between port_a and port_b,
inStream(port_a.h_outflow) just returns port_b.h_outflow. For multiple-way connections,
mixing equations are generated, and special care is taken in order to avoid discontinuities
around zero flow rates. For more details, see this
<a href="../Documentation/Fluid/Stream-Connectors-Overview-Rationale.pdf">presentation</a>
which illustrates the stream concept rationale and the underlying technicalities.
</p>

<p>
A connector should have only the minimal number of variables to
describe the interface, otherwise there will be connection
restrictions in certain cases. Therefore, in the connector
no redundant variables are present, e.g., the temperature T
is not present because it can be computed from the connector
variables pressure p and specific enthalpy h.
</p>

<p>
Here are two simple examples to illustrate modeling with stream connectors. The first
one is a rigid adiabatic volume mixing two flows, where the kinetic and gravitational
terms in the energy balance are neglected for simplicity.
</p>

<pre>
model MixingVolume "Volume that mixes two flows"
  replaceable package Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialPureSubstance;
  FluidPort port_a, port_b;
  parameter Modelica.SIunits.Volume V "Volume of device";
  Modelica.SIunits.Mass             m "Mass in device";
  Modelica.SIunits.Energy           U "Inner energy in device";
  Medium.BaseProperties medium(preferredMediumStates=true) "Medium in the device";
equation
  // Definition of port variables
  port_a.p         = medium.p;
  port_b.p         = medium.p;
  port_a.h_outflow = medium.h;  // The stream variable always corresponds to the
  port_b.h_outflow = medium.h;  // properties of the fluid holdup (outgoing flow)

  // Total quantities
  m = V*medium.d;
  U = m*medium.u;
   // Mass and energy balance (actualStream(..) is a built-in operator for streams to
  // compute the right h, depending on the flow direction)
  der(m) = port_a.m_flow + port_b.m_flow;
  der(U) = port_a.m_flow*actualStream(port_a.h_outflow) +
           port_b.m_flow*actualStream(port_b.h_outflow);
end MixingVolume;
</pre>

<p>
The second example is the model of a component describing a lumped pressure loss
between two ports, with no energy storage and no heat transfer. An isenthalpic
transformation is assumed (changes in kinetic and potential energy between
inlet and outlet are neglected)
</p>
<pre>
model PressureLoss "Pressure loss component"
  replaceable package Medium=Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialPureSubstance;
  FluidPort port_a, port_b:
  Medium.ThermodynamicState port_a_state_inflow "State at port_a if inflowing";
  Medium.ThermodynamicState port_b_state_inflow "State at port_b if inflowing";
  Medium density d_a, d_b "Density at ports a and b if inflowing";
  replaceable function f "Function to compute the mass flow rate";
equation
  // Medium states for inflowing fluid
  port_a_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_a.p, inStream(port_a.h_outflow));
  port_b_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_b.p, inStream(port_b.h_outflow));
  // Mass balance
  0 = port_a.m_flow + port_b.m_flow;
  // Instantaneous propagation of enthalpy flow between the ports with
  // isenthalpic state transformation (no storage and no loss of energy)
  port_a.h_outflow = inStream(port_b.h_outflow);
  port_b.h_outflow = inStream(port_a.h_outflow);
  // (Regularized) Momentum balance
  port_a.m_flow = f(port_a.p, port_b.p, d_a, d_b);
end PressureLoss;
</pre>

<p>
If many such components are connected in series between two models with storage, the
specific enthalpies are propagated in both directions and available to all pressure
loss components, without problems when the mass flow goes through zero. The function
f then uses either d_a or d_b depending on the sign of port_a.p-port_b.p, with a
suitable regularization around zero to avoid discontinuities.
</p>

<p>
Please note that these models are highly idealized in order to explain the stream connector
concept. Device models in the library are much more complete, handling issues such as
initialization, steady vs. dynamic modelling, heat transfer from the outside, etc.
</p>

<h4>Multiple-substance media</h4>
<p>
Modelica.Fluid can handle models where the fluid contains multiple substances, so that its
composition can be characterized by mass fraction vectors.
</p>
<pre>
<strong>connector</strong> FluidPort
   <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
      "Medium model of the fluid";
   <strong>flow</strong> Medium.MassFlowRate m_flow;
      "Mass flow rate from the connection point into the component"
   Medium.AbsolutePressure p
      "Thermodynamic pressure in the connection point";
   <strong>stream</strong> Medium.SpecificEnthalpy h_outflow
       "Specific thermodynamic enthalpy close to the connection point if m_flow &lt; 0";
   <strong>stream</strong> Medium.MassFraction Xi_outflow[Medium.nXi]
       "Independent mixture mass fractions m_i/m close to the connection point if m_flow &lt; 0";
   <strong>stream</strong> Medium.ExtraProperty C_outflow[Medium.nC]
       "Properties c_i/m close to the connection point if m_flow &lt; 0";
  <strong>end</strong> FluidPort;
</pre>
The mass fraction vectors Xi and C are also stream quantities, as they are carried by the mass
flow rate. The corresponding connection equations are sum(m_flow*Xi) and sum(m_flow*C), which correspond to mass balances for the single substances. The vector Xi contains the mass fractions
of the main components of the fluid, and is used together with p and h to determine the
thermodynamic state of the fluid. The vector C contains the mass fraction of the trace components,
which are accounted for in mass balances, but is ignored when computing the fluid properties. This
allows to easily declare and use medium models with trace components starting from existing medium
models (e.g., adding CO<sub>2</sub> traces to Moist Air for air conditioning models).

<h4>Approximations in balance equations at connection point</h4>
<p>
Summing up, when two or more ports of the type FluidPort are connected, the following
equations are generated by the tool:
</p>
<pre>
sum(port_j.m_flow) = 0;               // Total Mass balance
port_j = port_k;                      // Momentum balance
sum(port_j.m_flow*h_connection) = 0;  // Energy balance
sum(port_j.m_flow*Xi_connection) = 0; // Single component mass balances
sum(port_j.m_flow*C_connection) = 0;  // Trace components mass balances
</pre>
<p>
It is <strong>very important</strong> to bear in mind that
</p>
<ul>
<li> the mass balances are always exact;</li>
<li> the momentum and energy balance are only exact when two port with the same
diameter are connected, because there is no friction and no change in fluid velocity.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In all other cases, i.e., different port diameters and/or multiple port connections:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The momentum balance does not consider friction effects and changes of pressure due to changes
in velocity.</li>
<li> There might thus be errors in the momentum balance of the order of magnitude
of the dynamic pressure &rho;v<sup>2</sup>/2.</li>
<li> The energy balance does not consider the kinetic terms (gravity terms cancel out due
to the infinitesimal size of the connection volume). There might thus be errors in the momentum balance of the order of magnitude of the kinetic energy v^2/2.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In many applications, where fluid speeds are low and thermal phenomena are mainly of interest,
these approximations are commonly made and lead to acceptable results.
In all other cases, explicit fitting and junction models should be used, that model explicitly
all the kinetic phenomena with the appropriate level of detail.

For one-dimensional flow

<p>
An alternative energy balance can be derived by multiplying
the momentum balance with "v" and subtracting it
from the energy balance 1 above. This results in
the "energy balance 2":
</p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
  <tr><td> Energy balance 2</td>
      <td> <img src="../Images/Fluid/UsersGuide/energyBalance2.png"
                alt="energyBalance2.png"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
This formulation separates the internal energy of the fluid from the kinetic energy of fluid flow.
The internal energy is treated by the energy balance 2, the kinetic energy is treated by the momentum balance equally well.
The evaluation of medium properties, which are independent of the kinetic energy, and the formulation of many fluid models is simplified with the energy balance 2.
The overall conservation of energy is achieved by considering the mutual dependencies of energy and momentum balance.
</p>
<p>
Some components in the library, like DynamicPipe, provide a rigorous implementation of mass,
momentum and energy balance, using the energy balance 2 equation. Other components, like Valves and
Fittings, neglect the impact of changes of the kinetic energy and potential energy on the energy
balance, because they are usually irrelevant compared to changes due to heat flows. The StaticPipe
component neglects the effect of kinetic energy, but includes the potential energy in the balance,
which might be substantial.
</p>
<p>
All modelling assumptions and simplifications are stated in the component documentation; please note that some of the assumptions might be stated in the base classes the
component inherits from.

<p>
When implementing a Fluid component, the difficult arises that
the value of intensive quantities (such as p, T, &rho;)
shall be accessed from the
<strong>upstream</strong> volume. For example, if the fluid flows
from volume A to volume B, then the intensive quantities of
volume B have no influence on the fluid between the
two volumes. On the other hand, if the flow direction is reversed,
the intensive quantities of volume A have no influence
on the fluid between the two volumes.
</p>
<p>
In the Modelica.Fluid library, such a situation is handled
with the following code fragment
(from Interfaces.PartialTwoPortTransport):
</p>
<pre>    <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium =
                   Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium

    Medium.ThermodynamicState port_a_state_inflow
                    "Medium state close to port_a for inflowing mass flow";
    Medium.ThermodynamicState port_b_state_inflow
                    "Medium state close to port_b for inflowing mass flow";

  <strong>equation</strong>
    // Isenthalpic state transformation (no storage and no loss of energy)
    port_a.h_outflow  = <strong>inStream</strong>(port_b.h_outflow);
    port_b.h_outflow  = <strong>inStream</strong>(port_a.h_outflow);

    port_a.Xi_outflow = <strong>inStream</strong>(port_b.Xi_outflow);
    port_b.Xi_outflow = <strong>inStream</strong>(port_a.Xi_outflow);

    // Mass balance
    port_a.m_flow + port_b.m_flow = 0;

    // Medium states for inflowing medium
    port_a_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_a.p, port_b.h_outflow, port_b.Xi_outflow);
    port_b_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_b.p, port_a.h_outflow, port_a.Xi_outflow);

    // Densities close to the parts when mass flows in to the respective port
    port_a_rho_inflow = Medium.density(port_a_state_inflow);
    port_b_rho_inflow = Medium.density(port_b_state_inflow);

    // Pressure drop correlation (k_ab, k_ba are the loss factors for the two flow
    // directions; e.g., for a circular device: k = 8*zeta/(pi*diameter)^2)^2)
    m_flow = Utilities.regRoot2(port_a.p - port_b.p, dp_small,
                                port_a_rho_inflow/k1, port_b_rho_inflow/k2);
</pre>
<p>
The medium states for inflowing media can be used to compute density and dynamic
viscosity which in turn can be use to formulate the pressure drop equation.
The standard pressure drop equation
</p>

<pre>
   dp = port_a - port_b;
   m_flow = sqrt(2/(zeta*diameter))*if dp >= 0 then  sqrt(dp)
                                               else -sqrt(-dp)
</pre>

<p>
cannot be used, since the function has an infinite derivative at dp=0.
Instead the region around zero mass flow rate must be regularized using
one of the regularization functions of Modelica.Fluid.Utilities.
This requires to have density and/or other medium properties for both
flow directions at the same time. These media properties can be computed
from the medium states of the inflowing fluid at the two ports.
</p>

<p>
If the above component is connected between two volumes, i.e.,
the independent medium variables in port_a and port_b are
usually states, then port_a.h and port_b.h are either states
(i.e., known quantities in the model) or are computed from
states. In either case they are "known". In such a situation,
all equations can be directly evaluated without any problems.
Zero or reversed mass flow rate does not pose any problems because
the medium properties are always computed for both flow directions
and are then used in the regularization function.
</p>

<p>
If 3 or more components are connected together, it can be shown
that a system of non-linear algebraic equations appear.
The equations are written by purpose in such a form, that
a tool can select mass flow rates and pressures as iteration
variables of this system. The advantage is that these iteration
variables are continuous and even often differentiable. The
alternative to use the medium states as iteration variables
is not good, because T,h,d are discontinuous for reversing flow
direction.

<p>
Pressure drop equations and other fluid characteristics are usually
computed by <strong>semi-empirical</strong> equations. Unfortunately, the developers
of semi-empirical equations nearly never take into account that the
equation might be used in a simulation program. As a consequence, these
semi-empirical equations can nearly never be used blindly but must
be slightly modified or adapted in order that obvious
simulation problems are avoided. Below, examples are given to
demonstrate what problems occur and how to regularize the characteristics:
</p>

<h4>Square root function</h4>
<p>
In several empirical formulae, expressions of the following form
are present, e.g., for turbulent flow in a pipe:
</p>
<pre>   y = <strong>if</strong> x &lt; 0 <strong>then</strong> -<strong>sqrt</strong>( <strong>abs</strong>(x) ) <strong>else</strong> <strong>sqrt</strong>(x)
</pre>
<p>
A plot of this characteristic is shown in the next figure:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Fluid/UsersGuide/sqrt.png"
     alt="sqrt.png">
</p>

<p>
The difficulty with this function is that the derivative at x=0 is infinity.
In reality, such a function does not exist. E.g., for pipe flow,
the flow becomes laminar for small velocities and therefore around zero the
sqrt() function is replaced by a linear function. Since the laminar region is
usually of not much practical interest, the above approximation is used.
</p>
<p>
The direct implementation above does not work in Modelica, because
an event is generated when x &lt; 0 changes sign. In order to detect
this event, an event iteration takes place. During the event iteration,
the active if-branch is not changed. For example, assume that x is positive
(= "else" branch) and shall become negative. During the event iteration
x is slightly negative and the else branch, i.e., sqrt(x), is evaluated.
Since this results in an imaginary number, an error occurs.
It would be possible to fix this, by using the <strong>noEvent</strong>() operator
to explicitly switch of an event:
</p>
<pre>   y = <strong>if</strong> <strong>noEvent</strong>(x &lt; 0) <strong>then</strong> -<strong>sqrt</strong>( <strong>abs</strong>(x) ) <strong>else</strong> <strong>sqrt</strong>(x)
</pre>
<p>
Still, it is highly likely that good integrators will not work well
around x=0, because they will recognize that the derivative changes very
sharply and will reduce the step size drastically.
</p>
<p>
There are several solutions around this problem: Around x=0, the sqrt() function
can be replaced by a polynomial of 3rd order which is determined in such a way
that it smoothly touches the sqrt() function, i.e., the whole function is continuous
and continuously differentiable. In the Modelica.Fluid library, implementations of
such critical functions are provided in sublibrary Modelica.Fluid.Utilities.
The above sqrt() type function is computed by function <strong>Utilities.regRoot</strong>().
This function is defined as:
</p>
<pre>     y := x/(x*x+delta*delta)^0.25;
</pre>
<p>
where "delta" is the size of the small region around zero where the
sqrt() function is approximated by another function. The plot of the
function above is practically identical to the one of the original function.
However, it has a finite derivative at x=0 and is differentiable up to
any order. With the default value of delta=0.01, the difference between
the function above and regRoot(x) is 16% around x=0.01, 0.25% around x=0.1
and 0.0025% around x=1.

>Modelica.Fluid.UsersGuide.ComponentDefinition</a>.WallFriction</h2>


<p>
One important special case for a pressure loss is the friction at the
wall of a pipe under the assumption of quasi steady state flow (i.e., the
mass flow rate varies only slowly). In this section it is explained how this case is
handled in the Modelica.Fluid library for pipes with
<strong>nonuniform roughness</strong>, including the smooth pipe
as a special case (see
<a href="Modelica_Fluid_Pipes_BaseClasses_WallFriction.html#Modelica.Fluid.Pipes.BaseClasses.WallFriction"
>Pipes.BaseClasses.WallFriction</a>).
The treatment is non-standard in order to get a
numerically well-posed description.
</p>

<p>
For pipes with circular cross section the pressure drop is computed as:
</p>

<pre>
   dp = &lambda;(Re,<font face="Symbol">D</font>)*(L/D)*&rho;*v*|v|/2
      = &lambda;(Re,<font face="Symbol">D</font>)*8*L/(&pi;^2*D^5*&rho;)*m_flow*|m_flow|
      = &lambda;2(Re,<font face="Symbol">D</font>)*k2*sign(m_flow);

with
   Re     = |v|*D*&rho;/&mu;
          = |m_flow|*4/(&pi;*D*&mu;)
   m_flow = A*v*&rho;
   A      = &pi;*(D/2)^2
   &lambda;2     = &lambda;*Re^2
   k2     = L*&mu;^2/(2*D^3*&rho;)
</pre>

<p>
where
</p>
<ul>
<li> L is the length of the pipe.</li>
<li> D is the diameter of the pipe. If the pipe has not a
     circular cross section, D = 4*A/P, where A is the cross section
     area and P is the wetted perimeter.</li>
<li> &lambda; = &lambda;(Re,<font face="Symbol">D</font>) is the "usual" wall friction coefficient.</li>
<li> &lambda;2 = &lambda;*Re^2 is the used friction coefficient to get a numerically
     well-posed formulation.</li>
<li> Re = |v|*D*&rho;/&mu; is the Reynolds number.</li>
<li> <font face="Symbol">D</font> = <font face="Symbol">d</font>/D is the relative roughness where
     "<font face="Symbol">d</font>" is
     the absolute "roughness", i.e., the averaged height of asperities in the pipe
     (<font face="Symbol">d</font> may change over time due to growth of surface asperities during
      service, see <em>[Idelchik 1994, p. 85, Tables 2-1, 2-2])</em>.</li>
<li> &rho; is the upstream density.</li>
<li> &mu; is the upstream dynamic viscosity.</li>
<li> v is the mean velocity.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The first form with &lambda; is used and presented in textbooks,
see "blue" curve in the next figure:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Fluid/Components/PipeFriction1.png" alt="PipeFriction1">
</p>

<p>
This form is not suited for a simulation program since
&lambda; = 64/Re if Re &lt; 2000, i.e., a division by zero occurs for
zero mass flow rate because Re = 0 in this case.
More useful for a simulation model is the friction coefficient
&lambda;2 = &lambda;*Re^2, because &lambda;2 = 64*Re if Re &lt; 2000 and
therefore no problems for zero mass flow rate occur.
The characteristic of &lambda;2 is shown in the next figure and is
used in Modelica.Fluid:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Fluid/Components/PipeFriction2.png" alt="PipeFriction2">
</p>

<p>
The pressure loss characteristic is divided into three regions:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Region 1</strong>:
     For <strong>Re &le; 2000</strong>, the flow is <strong>laminar</strong> and the exact solution of the
     3-dim. Navier-Stokes equations (momentum and mass balance) is used under the
     assumptions of steady flow, constant pressure gradient and constant
     density and viscosity (= Hagen-Poiseuille flow) leading to &lambda;2 = 64*Re.
     Therefore:
     <pre> dp = 128*&mu;*L/(&pi;*D^4*&rho;)*m_flow </pre><br>&nbsp;
</li>

<li> <strong>Region 3</strong>:
     For <strong>Re &ge; 4000</strong>, the flow is <strong>turbulent</strong>.
     Depending on the calculation direction (see "inverse formulation"
     below) either of two explicit equations are used. If the pressure drop dp
     is assumed to be known, &lambda;2 = |dp|/k2. The
     Colebrook-White equation
     <em>[Colebrook 1939; Idelchik 1994, p. 83, eq. (2-9)]</em>:
     <pre>1/sqrt(&lambda;) = -2*lg( 2.51/(Re*sqrt(&lambda;)) + 0.27*<font face="Symbol">D</font>) </pre>
     gives an implicit relationship between Re and &lambda;.
     Inserting &lambda;2 = &lambda;*Re^2 allows to solve this equation analytically
     for Re: <pre>Re = -2*sqrt(&lambda;2)*lg(2.51/sqrt(&lambda;2) + 0.27*<font face="Symbol">D</font>)</pre>
     Finally, the mass flow rate m_flow is computed from Re via
     m_flow = Re*&pi;*D*&mu;/4*sign(dp).
     These are the <strong>red</strong> curves in the diagrams above.<br>
     If the mass flow rate is assumed known (and therefore implicitly
     also the Reynolds number), then &lambda;2 is computed by an
     approximation of the inverse of the Colebrook-White equation
     <em>[Swamee and Jain 1976;
     Miller 1990, p. 191, eq.(8.4)]</em> adapted to &lambda;2:
     <pre> &lambda;2 = 0.25*(Re/lg(<font face="Symbol">D</font>/3.7 + 5.74/Re^0.9))^2 </pre>
     The pressure drop is then computed as dp = k2*&lambda;2*sign(m_flow).
     These are the <strong>blue</strong> curves in the diagrams above.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li> <strong>Region 2</strong>:
     For <strong>2000 &le; Re &le; 4000</strong> there is a transition region between laminar
     and turbulent flow. The value of &lambda;2 depends on more factors as just
     the Reynolds number and the relative roughness, therefore only crude
     approximations are possible in this area.<br>
     The deviation from the laminar region depends on the
     relative roughness. A laminar flow at Re=2000 is only reached for smooth pipes.
     The deviation Reynolds number Re1 is computed according to
     <em>[Samoilenko 1968; Idelchik 1994, p. 81, sect. 2.1.21]</em> as:
     <pre>Re1 = 745*e^(if <font face="Symbol">D</font> &le; 0.0065 then 1 else 0.0065/<font face="Symbol">D</font>)</pre>
     These are the <strong>blue</strong> curves in the diagrams above.<br>
     Between Re1=Re1(<font face="Symbol">d</font>/D) and Re2=4000,
     &lambda;2 is approximated by a cubic
     polynomial in the "lg(&lambda;2) - lg(Re)" chart (see figures above) such that the
     first derivative is continuous at these two points. In order to avoid
     the solution of non-linear equations, two different cubic polynomials are used
     for the direct and the inverse formulation. This leads to some discrepancies
     in &lambda;2 (= differences between the red and the blue curves).
     This is acceptable, because the transition region is anyway not
     precisely known since the actual friction coefficient depends on
     additional factors and since the operating points are usually
     not in this region.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The absolute roughness <font face="Symbol">d</font> has usually to
be estimated. In <em>[Idelchik 1994, pp. 105-109,
Table 2-5; Miller 1990, p. 190, Table 8-1]</em> many examples are given.
As a short summary:
</p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
  <tr><td><strong>Smooth pipes</strong></td>
      <td>Drawn brass, copper, aluminium, glass, etc.</td>
      <td><font face="Symbol">d</font> = 0.0025 mm</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td rowspan="3"><strong>Steel pipes</strong></td>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>
The equations above are valid for incompressible flow.
They can also be applied for <strong>compressible</strong> flow up to about <strong>Ma = 0.6</strong>
(Ma is the Mach number) with a maximum error in &lambda; of about 3 %.
The effect of gas compressibility in a wide region can be taken into
account by the following formula derived by Voronin
<em>[Voronin 1959; Idelchik 1994, p. 97, sect. 2.1.81]</em>:
</p>
<pre>
  &lambda;_comp = &lambda;*(1 + (&kappa;-1)/2 * Ma^2)^(-0.47)
</pre>
<p>
where &kappa; is the isentropic coefficient
(for ideal gases, &kappa; is the ratio of specific heat capacities cp/cv).
An appreciable decrease in the coefficient "&lambda;_comp" is observed
only in a narrow transonic region and also at supersonic flow velocities
by about 15% <em>[Idelchik 1994, p. 97, sect. 2.1.81]</em>.
This effect is not yet included in Modelica.Fluid.
Another restriction is that the pressure drop model is valid
only for steady state or slowly changing mass flow rate.
For large fluid acceleration, the pressure drop depends additionally
on the frequency of the changing mass flow rate.
</p>

<h4>Inverse formulation</h4>

<p>
In the "Advanced menu" it is possible via parameter
"from_dp" to define in which form the
pressure drop equation is actually evaluated (<strong>default</strong> is from_dp = <strong>true</strong>):
</p>
<pre>
   from_dp = <strong>true</strong>:   m_flow = f1(dp)
           = <strong>false</strong>:  dp     = f2(m_flow)
</pre>
<p>
"from_dp" can be useful to avoid nonlinear systems of equations
in cases where the inverse pressure loss function is needed.
</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>
A detailed pressure drop model for pipe wall friction is
provided in the form m_flow = f1(dp, <font face="Symbol">D</font>) or
dp = f2(m_flow, <font face="Symbol">D</font>).
These functions are continuous and differentiable,
are provided in an explicit form without solving non-linear equations,
and do behave well also at small mass flow rates. This pressure drop
model can be used stand-alone in a static momentum balance and in
a dynamic momentum balance as the friction pressure drop term.
It is valid for incompressible and compressible flow up to a Mach number of 0.6.

<p>
The control valves in
<a href="Modelica_Fluid_Valves.html#Modelica.Fluid.Valves"
>Modelica.Fluid.Valves</a>
have the parameters <strong>Kv</strong> and <strong>Cv</strong>. They are defined
as unit-less variables, but in the description text a unit
is given. The reason for this definition is the following:
</p>

<p>
The basic equation for valves is:
</p>

<pre>
  q = Av*sqrt(dp/rho)
</pre>

<p>
In SI units, [q] is m3/s, [dp] is Pascal, [rho] is [kg/m3], and Av is an area, thus [Av] = m2. Basically, the equation stems from Bernoulli's law. Av is roughly 1.4 times the area of the valve throat. Now, usually valves aren't so big that their throat area is of the order of magnitude of square meters - depending on the applications it is from a few square millimeters to a few square centimeters. Therefore, in the common engineering practice, the following equations are used:
</p>

<p>
Europe:
</p>

<pre>
  q = Kv sqrt(dp/(rho/rho0)) , with [q] = m3/h, [dp] = bar
</pre>

<p>
US:
</p>

<pre>
  q = Cv sqrt(dp/(rho/rho0)) , with [q] = USG/min, [dp] = psi
</pre>

<p>
In both cases rho0 is the density of cold water at 4 &deg;C, 999 kg/m3. Note that these equations use relative, not absolute densities.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that Kv = 1e6/27.7*Av and Cv = 1e6/24*Av, so both US and EU engineers get more or less the same numbers (just by sheer luck), with a range between a few units and a few hundred units for typical industrial applications, and everybody is happy.
</p>

<p>
Now, we've got two problems here. First, depending on the unit, we change the equation: with SI units, we use the density, with non-SI units, we use the relative density. So the quantities (not only the units!) of Av and Cv/Kv are different.
</p>

<p>
Second, the units of Kv and Cv are usually labeled "m3/h" and "USG/min", but as a matter of fact they are different, as can be seen from the equations above: they are actually
m3/(h*sqrt(bar)) and USG/(min*sqrt(psi)). If I have a valve with Kv = 10 m3/h, it means I get 10 m3/h "for a pressure drop of 1 bar". Unfortunately, this is not correct from the point of view of strict dimensional analysis, but nobody uses sqrt(Pa) or sqrt(bar).
</p>

<p>
You might think this is crazy (it is, especially when you try to explain it), but as a matter of fact the valve coefficient is <strong>never</strong> given in square meters in any catalog or datasheet; Cv is still the most used (even in Europe), followed by Kv. So, it will be very inconvenient for users to type in Av in square meters.
</p>

<p>
The pragmatic approach used in Modelica.Fluid.ControlValves is to accept the fact that m3/h and USG/min are not the real units of Cv and Kv, so we can't use the general unit conversion mechanism, put them just as mnemonic labels in the comment, use non-dimensional coefficients in the interface, and then define properly dimensioned unit conversion within the model
