<p>
Library <strong>MultiBody</strong> is a <strong>free</strong> Modelica package providing
3-dimensional mechanical components to model in a convenient way
<strong>mechanical systems</strong>, such as robots, mechanisms, vehicles.
A basic feature is that all components have <strong>animation</strong> information
with appropriate default sizes and colors. A typical screenshot of the
animation of a double pendulum is shown in the figure below, together
with its schematic.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/Examples/Elementary/DoublePendulumSmall.png">

<img src="../Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/Tutorial/DoublePendulumDiagramSmall.png" alt="double pendulum (diagram layer)">
</p>

<p>
Note, that all components - the coordinate system of the world frame,
the gravity acceleration vector, the revolute joints and the
bodies - are visualized in the animation.<br>
This library replaces the long available ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody
library, since it is much more easier to use and more powerful.
The main features of the library are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>About <strong>60 main components</strong>, i.e., joint, force, part,
    body, sensor and visualizer components that are ready to use
    and have useful default animation properties. One-dimensional
    force laws can be defined with components of the Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational
    and of the Modelica.Mechanics.Translational library and can be
    connected via available flange connectors to MultiBody
    components.</li>
<li>About <strong>75 functions</strong> to operate in a convenient way on
    orientation objects, e.g., to transform vector quantities between
    frames, or compute the orientation object of a planar rotation.
    The basic idea is to hide the actual definition of an <strong>orientation</strong>
    by providing essentially an <strong>Orientation</strong> type together with
    <strong>functions</strong> operating on instances of this type. Orientation
    objects based on a 3x3 transformation matrix and on quaternions
    are provided. As a side effect, the equations in all other
    components are simpler and easier to understand.</li>
<li> <strong>A World model</strong> has to be present in every model on top
     level. Here the gravity field is defined (currently: no gravity,
     uniform gravity, point gravity), the visualization of the
     world coordinate system and default settings for animation.
     If a world model is not present, it is automatically provided
     together with a warning message.</li>
<li><strong>Built-in animation properties</strong> of all components, such as
    joints, forces, bodies, sensors. This allows an easy visual
    check of the constructed model. Animation of every component
    can be switched off via a parameter. The animation of a complete
    system can be switched off via one parameter in the <strong>world</strong>
    model. If animation is switched off, all equations related
    to animation are removed from the generated code. This is especially
    important for real-time simulation.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic handling of kinematic loops</strong>.
    Components can be connected together in a nearly arbitrary fashion.
    It does not matter whether components are flipped. This does not
    influence the efficiency. If kinematic loop structures occur,
    this is automatically handled in an efficient way by a new
    technique to transform a certain class of overdetermined sets of
    differential algebraic equations symbolically to a system where
    the number of equations and unknowns are the same (the user need
    <strong>not</strong> cut loops with special cut-joints to construct a
    tree-structure).</li>
<li><strong>Automatic state selection from joints and bodies</strong>.
    Most joints and all bodies have potential states. A Modelica
    translator will use the generalized coordinates
    of joints as states if possible. If this is not possible,
    states are selected from body coordinates. As a consequence,
    strange joints with 6 degrees of freedom are not necessary
    to define a body moving freely in space. An advanced user
    may select states manually from the <strong>Advanced</strong> menu of the
    corresponding components or use a Modelica parameter modification
    to set the "stateSelect" attribute directly.</li>
<li> <strong>Analytic solution of kinematic loops</strong>. The non-linear
    equations occurring in kinematic loops are solved <strong>analytically</strong>
    for a large class of mechanisms, such as a 4 bar mechanism,
    a slider-crank mechanism or a MacPherson suspension. This is performed
    by constructing such loops with assembly joints JointXXX,
    available in the Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Joints package. Assembly joints consist
    of 3 joints that have together 6 degrees of freedom, i.e., no
    constraints.They do not have potential states. When the motion
    of the two frame connectors are provided, a non-linear system of
    equation is solved analytically to compute the motion of the 3 joints.
    Analytic loop handling is especially important for real-time simulation.</li>
<li> <strong>Line force components may have mass</strong>.
     Masses of line force components are located on the line on which
     the force is acting. They approximate the mass properties of
     a real physical device by one or two point masses. For example,
     a spring has often significant mass that has to be taken into
     account. If masses are set to zero, the additional code to handle
     these point masses is removed. If the masses are taken into
     account, the calculation overhead is small (the reason is that
     the occurring kinematic loops are analytically solved).</li>
<li> <strong>Force components may be connected directly together</strong>, e.g.,
     3-dimensional springs in series connection. Usually,
     multi-body programs have the restriction that force components
     can only be connected between two bodies. Such restrictions are
     not present in the Modelica multi-body library, since it is
     a fully object-oriented, equation based library. Usually, if
     force components are connected directly together, non-linear
     systems of equations occur. The advantage is often, that this
     may avoid stiff systems that would occur if a small mass has
     to be put in between the two force elements.</li>
<li><strong>Initialization definition is available via menus</strong>.
    Initialization of states in joints and bodies can be
    performed in the parameter menu, <strong>without</strong> typing Modelica
    statements. For non-standard initialization, the usual
    Modelica commands can be used.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-body specific error messages</strong>. Annotations
    and assert statements have been introduced that provide
    in many cases warning or error messages that are related
    to the library components (and not to specific equations
    as it is usual in Modelica libraries). This requires
    appropriate tool support, as it is.</li>
<li><strong>Inverse models</strong> of mechanical systems can be easily
    defined by using motion generators, e.g.,
    Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Position. Also, non-standard
    inverse models can be generated, e.g., when elasticity is present
    it might be necessary to differentiate equations several times.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a first example it shall be demonstrated how to build up, simulate
and animate a <strong>simple pendulum</strong>.
</p>
<p>
A simple pendulum consisting of a <strong>body</strong> and a <strong>revolute</strong> joint
with <strong>linear damping</strong> in the joint, is first build-up as
Modelica composition diagram, resulting in:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/Tutorial/FirstExample/PenulumSchematic1.png"
alt="Modelica composition diagram of simple pendulum">
</p>

<p>
In the following figure the location of the used
model components is shown. Drag these components in the diagram layer
and connect them according to the figure:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/Tutorial/FirstExample/PenulumSchematic2.png">
</p>

<p>
Every model that uses model components from the MultiBody library
must have an instance of the Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.World model on highest level.
The reason is that in the world object the gravity field is defined
(uniform gravity or point gravity), as well as the default sizes of
animation shapes and this information is reported to all used
components. If the World object is missing, a warning message is
printed and an instance of the World object with default settings is
automatically utilized (this feature is defined with annotations).
</p>
<p>
In a second step the parameters of the dragged components need to be
defined. Some parameters are vectors that have to be defined with respect
to a local coordinate system of the corresponding component. The easiest
way to perform this is to define a <strong>reference configuration</strong> of your
multi-body model: In this configuration, the relative coordinates of
all joints are zero. This means that all coordinate systems on all
components are parallel to each other. Therefore, this just means
that all vectors are resolved in the world frame in this configuration.
</p>
<p>
The reference configuration for the simple pendulum shall be defined
in the following way: The y-axis of the world frame is directed
upwards, i.e., the opposite direction of the gravity acceleration.
The x-axis of the world frame is orthogonal to it. The revolute joint
is placed in the origin of the world frame. The rotation axis of the revolute
joint is directed along the z-axis of the world frame. The body is
placed on the x-axis of the world frame (i.e., the rotation angle of the
revolute joint is zero, when the body is on the x-axis).
In the following figures the definition of this reference configuration
is shown in the parameter menus of the revolute joint and the body:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/Tutorial/FirstExample/ActuatedRevolute.png">
<br>
<img src="../Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/Tutorial/FirstExample/Body.png">
</p>

<p>
Translate and simulate the model.
Automatically, all defined components are visualized in
an animation using default absolute or relative sizes
of the components. For example, a body is visualized as
a sphere and as a cylinder. The default size of the sphere is defined
as parameter in the world object. You may change this size
in the "Animation" parameter menu of the body (see parameter menu
above). The default size of the cylinder is defined relatively
to the size of the sphere (half of the sphere size).
With default settings, the following animation is defined:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/Examples/Elementary/Pendulum.png">
</p>

<p>
The world coordinate system is visualized as coordinate system
with axes labels. The direction of the gravity acceleration
vector is shown as green arrow. The red cylinder represents
the rotation axis of the revolute joint and the light blue
shapes represent the body. The center of mass of the body is
in the middle of the light blue sphere.

>Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.UsersGuide.Tutorial</a>.ConnectionOfLineForces</h2>

<p>
Line force elements, such as a
<a href="Modelica_Mechanics_MultiBody_Forces.html#Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Forces.Spring"
>Spring</a>,
are usually connected between two parts. In fact, this is the only possibility
in most multi-body programs. In an equation based system like Modelica, more
general connections are possible. In particular
<strong>3-dimensional line force</strong> elements can be connected together
in <strong>series</strong> without having a body with mass at the
connection point. This is advantageous since stiff systems can be avoided, say, due to
a stiff spring and a small mass at the connection point.
For an example, see model
<a href="Modelica_Mechanics_MultiBody_Examples_Elementary.html#Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Examples.Elementary.ThreeSprings"
>ThreeSprings</a>:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/Examples/Elementary/ThreeSprings.png">
</p>

<p>
Here, three springs are connected together at one point, without having a body
at the connection point of the springs. There is one difficulty: In such a situation
the orientation object at the connection point is undefined, because
the springs do not transmit torques. Translation will therefore fail, if three springs
and a body are connected together in this way. To handle such a case, all line force
elements have flags "fixedRotationAtFrame_a" and "fixedRotationAtFrame_b" in their
"Advanced" parameter menu. For example, if "fixedRotationAtFrame_b = <strong>true</strong>",
the orientation object at frame_b is explicitly set to a null rotation, i.e.,
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
frame_b.R = Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Frames.nullRotation();
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This means that the coordinate system in the connection point of the three springs
is always parallel to the world frame. When this option is selected, the corresponding
frame in the line force icon is marked with a red circle and with the text "R=0".
This is shown in the next figure, where this option is selected for spring3.frame_b:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/ThreeSpringsDiagramLayer.png">
</p>

<p>
Note, if this flag is not set to <strong>true</strong>, a translation error will occur.
Due to the usage of overdetermined connectors in the MultiBody library, the error
message will be something like: .
</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The overdetermined connectors &lt;...&gt; are connected but do not have any root defined"
</p></blockquote>

<p>
The two flags "fixedRotationAtFrame_a" and "fixedRotationAtFrame_b must be set very carefully
because a wrong definition can lead to a model that simulates, but the simulation
result is wrong. This is the case whenever the movement of the resulting system depends
on the orientation object that was arbitrarily set in parallel to the world frame.
A typical example is shown in the next figure:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/ThreeSprings2DiagramLayer.png">
</p>

<p>
Here, spring3.frame_b.R is defined to be in parallel to the world frame.
However, this is then also the orientation of fixedTranslation.frame_a, and this
in turn means that the left part of the fixedTranslation object is always in parallel
to the world frame. Since this is not correct, this model
will result in a <strong>wrong simulation result</strong>
This system is mathematically not well-defined and does not have a solution.
The only way to model such a system is by providing a mass and an inertia tensor
to fixedTranslation. Then, the flags are not needed, because the "connection"
point of the springs is a body where the absolution position vector and the
orientation matrix of the body-fixed coordinate system are used as states.
