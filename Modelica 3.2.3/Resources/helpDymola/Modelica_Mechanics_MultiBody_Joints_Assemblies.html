</p>
<h3>Information</h3>

<p>
The joints in this package are mainly designed to be used
in <strong>kinematic loop</strong> structures. Every component consists of
<strong>3 elementary joints</strong>. These joints are combined in such a
way that the kinematics of the 3 joints between frame_a and
frame_b are computed from the movement of frame_a and frame_b,
i.e., there are <strong>no constraints</strong> between frame_a and frame_b.
This requires to solve a <strong>non-linear system of equations</strong> which
is performed <strong>analytically</strong> (i.e., when a mathematical
solution exists, it is computed efficiently and reliably).
A detailed description how to use these joints is provided in
<a href="Modelica_Mechanics_MultiBody_UsersGuide_Tutorial_LoopStructures.html#Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.UsersGuide.Tutorial.LoopStructures.AnalyticLoopHandling"
>MultiBody.UsersGuide.Tutorial.LoopStructures.AnalyticLoopHandling</a>.
</p>
<p>
The assembly joints in this package are named <strong>JointXYZ</strong> where
<strong>XYZ</strong> are the first letters of the elementary joints used in the
component, in particular:
</p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
  <tr><td><strong>P</strong></td><td>Prismatic joint</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>R</strong></td><td>Revolute joint</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>S</strong></td><td>Spherical joint</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>U</strong></td><td>Universal joint</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
For example, JointUSR is an assembly joint consisting
of a universal, a spherical and a revolute joint.

</table>
<p>
Note, no component of this package has potential states, since the
components are designed in such a way that the generalized coordinates
of the used elementary joints are computed from the frame_a and frame_b
coordinates. Still, it is possible to use the components in a
tree structure. In this case states are selected from bodies that are
connected to the frame_a or frame_b side of the component.
In most cases this gives a less efficient solution, as if elementary
joints of package Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Joints would be used directly.
</p>
<p>
The analytic handling of kinematic loops by using joint aggregations
with 6 degrees of freedom as provided in this package, is a <strong>new</strong>
methodology. It is based on a more general method for solving
non-linear equations of kinematic loops developed by Woernle and
Hiller. An automatic application of this more general method
is difficult, and a manual application is only suited for
specialists in this field. The method introduced here is a
compromise: It can be quite easily applied by an end user, but
for a smaller class of kinematic loops. The method of the "characteristic
pair of joints" from Woernle and Hiller is described in:

</p>
<h3>Information</h3>

<p>
This component consists of a <strong>universal</strong> joint at frame_a,
a <strong>spherical</strong> joint at frame_b and a <strong>prismatic</strong> joint along the
line connecting the origin of frame_a and the origin of frame_b,
see the default animation in the following figure (the axes vectors
are not part of the default animation):
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/Joints/JointUPS.png" alt="model Joints.Assemblies.JointUPS">
</p>

<p>
This joint aggregation has no mass and no inertia and
introduces neither constraints nor potential state variables.
It is especially useful to build up more complicated force elements
where the mass and/or inertia of the force element shall be taken
into account.
</p>
<p>
The universal joint is defined in the following way:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The rotation <strong>axis</strong> of revolute joint <strong>1</strong> is along parameter
     vector n1_a which is fixed in frame_a.</li>
<li> The rotation <strong>axis</strong> of revolute joint <strong>2</strong> is perpendicular to
     axis 1 and to the line connecting the universal and the spherical joint.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The definition of axis 2 of the universal joint is performed according
to the most often occurring case. In a future release, axis 2 might
be explicitly definable via a parameter. However, the treatment is much more
complicated and the number of operations is considerably higher,
if axis 2 is not orthogonal to axis 1 and to the connecting rod.
</p>
<p>
Note, there is a <strong>singularity</strong> when axis 1 and the connecting line are parallel
to each other. Therefore, if possible n1_a should be selected in such a way that it
is perpendicular to nAxis_ia in the initial configuration (i.e., the
distance to the singularity is as large as possible).
</p>
<p>
An additional <strong>frame_ia</strong> is present. It is <strong>fixed</strong> on the line
connecting the universal and the spherical joint at the
origin of <strong>frame_a</strong>. The placement of frame_ia on this line
is implicitly defined by the universal joint (frame_a and frame_ia coincide
when the angles of the two revolute joints of the universal joint are zero)
and by parameter vector <strong>nAxis_ia</strong>, an axis vector directed
along the line from the origin of frame_a to the spherical joint,
resolved in frame_<strong>ia</strong>.
</p>
<p>
An additional <strong>frame_ib</strong> is present. It is <strong>fixed</strong> in the line
connecting the prismatic and the spherical joint at the
origin of <strong>frame_b</strong>.
It is always parallel to <strong>frame_ia</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Note, this joint aggregation can be used in cases where
in reality a rod with spherical joints at each end are present.
Such a system has an additional degree of freedom to rotate
the rod along its axis. In practice this rotation is usually
of no interest and is mathematically removed by replacing one
of the spherical joints by a universal joint.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to define the parameters of this joint is by moving the
MultiBody system in a <strong>reference configuration</strong> where <strong>all frames</strong>
of all components are <strong>parallel</strong> to each other (alternatively,
at least frame_a, frame_ia and frame_ib of the JointUSP joint
should be parallel to each other when defining an instance of this
component).

<span class="ModelicaDescription">Universal - spherical - revolute joint aggregation (no constraints, no potential states)</span>
</p>
<h3>Information</h3>

<p>
This component consists of a <strong>universal</strong> joint at frame_a, a <strong>revolute</strong>
joint at frame_b and a <strong>spherical</strong> joint which is connected via <strong>rod1</strong>
to the universal and via <strong>rod2</strong> to the revolute joint, see the default
animation in the following figure (the axes vectors are not part of the
default animation):
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/Joints/JointUSR.png" alt="model Joints.Assemblies.JointUSR">
</p>

<p>
This joint aggregation has no mass and no inertia and
introduces neither constraints nor potential state variables.
It should be used in kinematic loops whenever possible since
the non-linear system of equations introduced by this joint aggregation
is solved <strong>analytically</strong> (i.e., a solution is always computed, if a
unique solution exists).
</p>
<p>
The universal joint is defined in the following way:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The rotation <strong>axis</strong> of revolute joint <strong>1</strong> is along parameter
     vector n1_a which is fixed in frame_a.</li>
<li> The rotation <strong>axis</strong> of revolute joint <strong>2</strong> is perpendicular to
     axis 1 and to the line connecting the universal and the spherical joint
     (= rod 1).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The definition of axis 2 of the universal joint is performed according
to the most often occurring case. In a future release, axis 2 might
be explicitly definable via a parameter. However, the treatment is much more
complicated and the number of operations is considerably higher,
if axis 2 is not orthogonal to axis 1 and to the connecting rod.
</p>
<p>
Note, there is a <strong>singularity</strong> when axis 1 and the connecting rod are parallel
to each other. Therefore, if possible n1_a should be selected in such a way that it
is perpendicular to rRod1_ia in the initial configuration (i.e., the
distance to the singularity is as large as possible).
</p>
<p>
The rest of this joint aggregation is defined by the following parameters:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The position of the spherical joint with respect to the universal
     joint is defined by vector <strong>rRod1_ia</strong>. This vector is directed from
     frame_a to the spherical joint and is resolved in frame_ia
     (it is most simple to select frame_ia such that it is parallel to
     frame_a in the reference or initial configuration).</li>
<li> The position of the spherical joint with respect to the revolute
     joint is defined by vector <strong>rRod2_ib</strong>. This vector is directed from
     the inner frame of the revolute joint (frame_ib or revolute.frame_a)
     to the spherical joint and is resolved in frame_ib (note, that frame_ib
     and frame_b are parallel to each other).</li>
<li> The axis of rotation of the revolute joint is defined by axis
     vector <strong>n_b</strong>. It is fixed and resolved in frame_b.</li>
<li> When specifying this joint aggregation with the definitions above, <strong>two</strong>
     different <strong>configurations</strong> are possible. Via parameter <strong>phi_guess</strong>
     a guess value for revolute.phi(t0) at the initial time t0 is given. The configuration is selected that is closest to phi_guess (|revolute.phi - phi_guess| is minimal).</li>
</ul>
<p>
An additional <strong>frame_ia</strong> is present. It is <strong>fixed</strong> in the rod
connecting the universal and the spherical joint at the
origin of <strong>frame_a</strong>. The placement of frame_ia on the rod
is implicitly defined by the universal joint (frame_a and frame_ia coincide
when the angles of the two revolute joints of the universal joint are zero)
and by parameter vector <strong>rRod1_ia</strong>, the position vector
from the origin of frame_a to the spherical joint, resolved in frame_<strong>ia</strong>.
</p>
<p>
An additional <strong>frame_ib</strong> is present. It is <strong>fixed</strong> in the rod
connecting the revolute and the spherical joint at the side of the revolute
joint that is connected to this rod (= rod2.frame_a = revolute.frame_a).
</p>
<p>
An additional <strong>frame_im</strong> is present. It is <strong>fixed</strong> in the rod
connecting the revolute and the spherical joint at the side of the spherical
joint that is connected to this rod (= rod2.frame_b).
It is always parallel to <strong>frame_ib</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to define the parameters of this joint is by moving the
MultiBody system in a <strong>reference configuration</strong> where <strong>all frames</strong>
of all components are <strong>parallel</strong> to each other (alternatively,
at least frame_a and frame_ia of the JointUSR joint
should be parallel to each other when defining an instance of this
component).
</p>
<p>
In the public interface of the JointUSR joint, the following
(final) <strong>parameters</strong> are provided:
</p>
<pre>
  <strong>parameter</strong> Real rod1Length(unit="m")  "Length of rod 1";
  <strong>parameter</strong> Real eRod1_ia[3] "Unit vector along rod 1, resolved in frame_ia";
  <strong>parameter</strong> Real e2_ia  [3]  "Unit vector along axis 2, resolved in frame_ia";
</pre>
<p>
This allows a more convenient definition of data which is related to rod 1.
For example, if a box shall be connected at frame_ia directing from
the origin of frame_a to the middle of rod 1, this might be defined as:
</p>
<pre>
    Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Joints.Assemblies.JointUSP jointUSR(rRod1_ia={1.2, 1, 0.2});

<span class="ModelicaDescription">Universal - spherical - prismatic joint aggregation (no constraints, no potential states)</span>
</p>
<h3>Information</h3>

<p>
This component consists of a <strong>universal</strong> joint at frame_a, a <strong>prismatic</strong>
joint at frame_b and a <strong>spherical</strong> joint which is connected via <strong>rod1</strong>
to the universal and via <strong>rod2</strong> to the prismatic joint, see the default
animation in the following figure (the axes vectors are not part of the
default animation):
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/Joints/JointUSP.png" alt="model Joints.Assemblies.JointUSP">
</p>

<p>
This joint aggregation has no mass and no inertia and
introduces neither constraints nor potential state variables.
It should be used in kinematic loops whenever possible since
the non-linear system of equations introduced by this joint aggregation
is solved <strong>analytically</strong> (i.e., a solution is always computed, if a
unique solution exists).
</p>
<p>
The universal joint is defined in the following way:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The rotation <strong>axis</strong> of revolute joint <strong>1</strong> is along parameter
     vector n1_a which is fixed in frame_a.</li>
<li> The rotation <strong>axis</strong> of revolute joint <strong>2</strong> is perpendicular to
     axis 1 and to the line connecting the universal and the spherical joint
     (= rod 1).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The definition of axis 2 of the universal joint is performed according
to the most often occurring case. In a future release, axis 2 might
be explicitly definable via a parameter. However, the treatment is much more
complicated and the number of operations is considerably higher,
if axis 2 is not orthogonal to axis 1 and to the connecting rod.
</p>
<p>
Note, there is a <strong>singularity</strong> when axis 1 and the connecting rod are parallel
to each other. Therefore, if possible n1_a should be selected in such a way that it
is perpendicular to rRod1_ia in the initial configuration (i.e., the
distance to the singularity is as large as possible).
</p>
<p>
The rest of this joint aggregation is defined by the following parameters:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The position of the spherical joint with respect to the universal
     joint is defined by vector <strong>rRod1_ia</strong>. This vector is directed from
     frame_a to the spherical joint and is resolved in frame_ia
     (it is most simple to select frame_ia such that it is parallel to
     frame_a in the reference or initial configuration).</li>
<li> The position of the spherical joint with respect to the prismatic
     joint is defined by vector <strong>rRod2_ib</strong>. This vector is directed from
     the inner frame of the prismatic joint (frame_ib or prismatic.frame_a)
     to the spherical joint and is resolved in frame_ib (note, that frame_ib
     and frame_b are parallel to each other).</li>
<li> The axis of translation of the prismatic joint is defined by axis
     vector <strong>n_b</strong>. It is fixed and resolved in frame_b.</li>
<li> The two frames of the prismatic joint, i.e., frame_b and frame_ib,
     are parallel to each other.
     The distance between the origins of these two frames along axis n_b
     is equal to "prismatic.s(t) + s_offset", where "prismatic.s(t)" is
     a time varying variable and "s_offset" is a fixed, constant offset
     parameter.</li>
<li> When specifying this joint aggregation with the definitions above, <strong>two</strong>
     different <strong>configurations</strong> are possible. Via parameter <strong>s_guess</strong>
     a guess value for prismatic.s(t0) at the initial time t0 is given. The configuration
     is selected that is closest to s_guess (|prismatic.s - s_guess| is minimal).</li>
</ul>
<p>
An additional <strong>frame_ia</strong> is present. It is <strong>fixed</strong> in the rod
connecting the universal and the spherical joint at the
origin of <strong>frame_a</strong>. The placement of frame_ia on the rod
is implicitly defined by the universal joint (frame_a and frame_ia coincide
when the angles of the two revolute joints of the universal joint are zero)
and by parameter vector <strong>rRod1_ia</strong>, the position vector
from the origin of frame_a to the spherical joint, resolved in frame_<strong>ia</strong>.
</p>
<p>
An additional <strong>frame_ib</strong> is present. It is <strong>fixed</strong> in the rod
connecting the prismatic and the spherical joint at the side of the prismatic
joint that is connected to this rod (= rod2.frame_a = prismatic.frame_a).
It is always parallel to <strong>frame_b</strong>.
</p>
<p>
An additional <strong>frame_im</strong> is present. It is <strong>fixed</strong> in the rod
connecting the prismatic and the spherical joint at the side of the spherical
joint that is connected to this rod (= rod2.frame_b).
It is always parallel to <strong>frame_b</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to define the parameters of this joint is by moving the
MultiBody system in a <strong>reference configuration</strong> where <strong>all frames</strong>
of all components are <strong>parallel</strong> to each other (alternatively,
at least frame_a and frame_ia of the JointUSP joint
should be parallel to each other when defining an instance of this
component).
</p>
<p>
In the public interface of the JointUSP joint, the following
(final) <strong>parameters</strong> are provided:
</p>
<pre>
  <strong>parameter</strong> Real rod1Length(unit="m")  "Length of rod 1";
  <strong>parameter</strong> Real eRod1_ia[3] "Unit vector along rod 1, resolved in frame_ia";
  <strong>parameter</strong> Real e2_ia  [3]  "Unit vector along axis 2, resolved in frame_ia";
</pre>
<p>
This allows a more convenient definition of data which is related to rod 1.
For example, if a box shall be connected at frame_ia directing from
the origin of frame_a to the middle of rod 1, this might be defined as:
</p>
<pre>
    Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Joints.Assemblies.JointUSP jointUSP(rRod1_ia={1.2, 1, 0.2});
    Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Visualizers.FixedShape     shape(shapeType       = "box",
                                               lengthDirection = jointUSP.eRod1_ia,
                                               widthDirection  = jointUSP.e2_ia,
                                               length          = jointUSP.rod1Length/2,
                                               width           = jointUSP.rod1Length/10);
  <strong>equation</strong>
    <strong>connect</strong>(jointUSP.frame_ia, shape.frame_a);

<h3>Information</h3>

<p>
This component consists of <strong>3 revolute</strong> joints with parallel
axes of rotation that are connected together by two rods, see the default
animation in the following figure (the axes vectors are not part of the
default animation):
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
This joint aggregation introduces neither constraints nor state variables and
should therefore be used in kinematic loops whenever possible to
avoid non-linear systems of equations. It is only meaningful to
use this component in <strong>planar loops</strong>. Basically, the position
and orientation of the 3 revolute joints as well as of frame_ia, frame_ib, and
frame_im are calculated by solving analytically a non-linear equation,
given the position and orientation at frame_a and at frame_b.
</p>
<p>
Connector <strong>frame_a</strong> is the "left" side of the first revolute joint
whereas <strong>frame_ia</strong> is the "right side of this revolute joint, fixed in rod 1.
Connector <strong>frame_b</strong> is the "right" side of the third revolute joint
whereas <strong>frame_ib</strong> is the "left" side of this revolute joint, fixed in rod 2.
Finally, connector <strong>frame_im</strong> is the connector at the "right" side
of the revolute joint in the middle, fixed in rod 2.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to define the parameters of this joint is by moving the
MultiBody system in a <strong>reference configuration</strong> where <strong>all frames</strong>
of all components are <strong>parallel</strong> to each other (alternatively,
at least frame_a, frame_ia, frame_im, frame_ib, frame_b of the JointRRR joint
should be parallel to each other when defining an instance of this
component).
</p>
<p>
Basically, the JointRRR model consists internally of a universal -
spherical - revolute joint aggregation (= JointUSR). In a planar
loop this will behave as if 3 revolute joints with parallel axes
are connected by rigid rods.
