Declare stream variable in a connector to describe bi-directional flow of matter
</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>

<blockquote>
<pre><strong>connector</strong> FluidPort
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
  Medium.AbsolutePressure        p          "Pressure in connection point";
  <strong>flow</strong>   Medium.MassFlowRate     m_flow     "&gt; 0, if flow into component";
  <strong>stream</strong> Medium.SpecificEnthalpy h_outflow  "h close to port if m_flow &lt; 0";
<strong>end</strong> FluidPort;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
FluidPort is a stream connector, because a connector variable has the
stream prefix. The Medium definition and the stream variables are associated
with the only flow variable (m_flow) that defines a fluid stream.
The Medium and the stream variables are transported with this flow variable.
The stream variable h_outflow is the stream property inside the component
close to the boundary, when fluid flows out of the component into
the connection point. The stream properties for the other flow direction
can be inquired with the built-in operator
<a href="ModelicaReference.Operators.'inStream()'.html">'inStream()'</a>. The value of the
stream variable corresponding to the actual flow direction can be
inquired through the built-in operator <a href="ModelicaReference.Operators.'actualStream()'.html">'actualStream()'</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><strong>model</strong> IsenthalpicFlow "No energy storage/losses, e.g., pressure drop, valve, ..."
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium=Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
  FluidPort port_a, port_b:
  Medium.ThermodynamicState port_a_state_inflow "State at port_a if inflowing";
  Medium.ThermodynamicState port_b_state_inflow "State at port_b if inflowing";
<strong>equation</strong>
  // Medium states for inflowing fluid
  port_a_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_a.p,
                                            <strong>inStream</strong>(port_a.h_outflow));
  port_b_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_b.p,
                                            <strong>inStream</strong>(port_b.h_outflow));
  // Mass balance
  0 = port_a.m_flow + port_b.m_flow;

  // Instantaneous propagation of enthalpy flow between the ports with
  // isenthalpic state transformation (no storage and no loss of energy)
  port_a.h_outflow = <strong>inStream</strong>(port_b.h_outflow);
  port_b.h_outflow = <strong>inStream</strong>(port_a.h_outflow);

  // (Regularized) Momentum balance
  port_a.m_flow = f(port_a.p, port_b.p,
                    Medium.density(port_a_state_inflow),
                    Medium.density(port_b_state_inflow));
<strong>end</strong> IsenthalpicFlow;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>When two or more FluidPort (inside) connectors are connected together, then <strong>no</strong>
connection equations are generated for <strong>stream</strong> variables. Instead, these
equations are constructed by the <strong>inStream</strong>(..) built-in operator
(see example model IsenthalpicFlow) above. If two IsenthalpicFlow components
are connected together:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>   IsenthalpicFlow dp1;
   IsenthalpicFlow dp2;
<strong>equation</strong>
  <strong>connect</strong>(dp1, dp2);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Then, the following connection equations are generated
</p>

<blockquote><pre>dp1.p = dp2.p;
0 = dp1.m_flow + dp2.m_flow;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Note, no equation for a stream variable is generated. However, the inStream(..)
operators inside the components provide the "ideal mixing" equations:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>// within dp1:
  <strong>inStream</strong>(dp1.port_b.h_outflow) := dp2.port_a.h_outflow;

// within dp2:
  <strong>inStream</strong>(dp2.port_a.h_outflow) := dp1.port_b.h_outflow;
</pre></blockquote>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>
A detailed description of the stream keyword and the inStream operator is given
in Chapter 15 and Appendix D of the
<a href="https://www.modelica.org/documents/ModelicaSpec32Revision1.pdf">Modelica Language Specification version 3.2 Revision 1</a>.
An overview and a rational is provided in a
<a href="resources/ModelicaReference.'stream'_info_001.pdf">slide set</a>.
</p>

<p>
The two basic variable types in a connector <strong>potential</strong> (or across) variable
and <strong>flow</strong> (or through) variable are not sufficient to describe in a numerically
sound way the bi-directional flow of matter with convective transport of specific
quantities, such as specific enthalpy and chemical composition. The values of these
specific quantities are determined from the upstream side of the flow, i.e., they depend
on the flow direction. When using across and through variables, the corresponding models
would include nonlinear systems of equations with Boolean unknowns for the flow directions
and singularities around zero flow. Such equation systems cannot be solved reliably in
general. The model formulations can be simplified when formulating two different balance
equations for the two possible flow directions. This is not possible with across and
through variables though.
</p>

<p>
This fundamental problem is addressed in Modelica 3.1 by
introducing a third type of connector variable, called stream variable,
declared with the prefix <strong>stream</strong>. A stream variable describes a quantity that
is carried by a flow variable, i.e., a purely convective transport phenomenon.
The value of the stream variable is the specific property inside the component
close to the boundary, assuming that matter flows out of the component into the
connection point. In other words, it is the value the carried quantity would
have if the fluid was flowing out of the connector, irrespective of the actual flow direction.
</p>

<p>
The basic idea is sketched at hand of an example:
Three connectors c1, c2, c3 with the definition
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
<strong>connector</strong> Demo
  Real        p;  // potential variable
  <strong>flow</strong>   Real m_flow;  // flow variable
  <strong>stream</strong> Real h;  // stream variable
<strong>end</strong> Demo;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
are connected together with
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
<strong>connect</strong>(c1,c2);
<strong>connect</strong>(c1,c3);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
then this leads to the following equations:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
// Potential variables are identical
c1.p = c2.p;
c1.p = c3.p;

// The sum of the flow variables is zero
0 = c1.m_flow + c2.m_flow + c3.m_flow;

/* The sum of the product of flow variables and upstream stream variables is zero
   (this implicit set of equations is explicitly solved when generating code;
   the "&lt;undefined&gt;" parts are defined in such a way that
   inStream(..) is continuous).
*/
0 = c1.m_flow*(<strong>if</strong> c1.m_flow > 0 <strong>then</strong> h_mix <strong>else</strong> c1.h) +
    c2.m_flow*(<strong>if</strong> c2.m_flow > 0 <strong>then</strong> h_mix <strong>else</strong> c2.h) +
    c3.m_flow*(<strong>if</strong> c3.m_flow > 0 <strong>then</strong> h_mix <strong>else</strong> c3.h);

<strong>inStream</strong>(c1.h) = <strong>if</strong> c1.m_flow > 0 <strong>then</strong> h_mix <strong>else</strong> &lt;undefined&gt;;
<strong>inStream</strong>(c2.h) = <strong>if</strong> c2.m_flow > 0 <strong>then</strong> h_mix <strong>else</strong> &lt;undefined&gt;;
<strong>inStream</strong>(c3.h) = <strong>if</strong> c3.m_flow > 0 <strong>then</strong> h_mix <strong>else</strong> &lt;undefined&gt;;

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If at least one variable in a connector has the stream prefix, the connector
is called <strong>stream connector</strong> and the corresponding variable is called
<strong>stream variable</strong>. The following definitions hold:
</p>

<ul>
<li> The stream prefix can only be used in a connector declaration.</li>
<li> A stream connector must have exactly one scalar variable with the flow prefix.
     [<em>The idea is that all stream variables of a connector are associated with
      this flow variable</em>].</li>
<li> For every outside connector, one equation is generated for every variable
     with the stream prefix [<em>to describe the propagation of the stream
     variable along a model hierarchy</em>]. For the exact definition,
     see the end of section 15.2.</li>
<li> For inside connectors, variables with the stream prefix do not lead to
     connection equations.</li>
<li> Connection equations with stream variables are generated in a
     model when using the inStream() operator or the actualStream() operator.</li>
</ul>

<a href="ModelicaReference.Operators.'inStream()'.html">'inStream()'</a> operator.
