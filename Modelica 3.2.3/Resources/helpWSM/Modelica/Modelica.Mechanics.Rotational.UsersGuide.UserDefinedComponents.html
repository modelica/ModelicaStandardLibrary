In this section some hints are given to define your own
1-dimensional rotational components which are compatible with the
elements of this package.
It is convenient to define a new
component by inheritance from one of the following base classes,
which are defined in sublibrary Interfaces:
</p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
<tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Interfaces.PartialCompliant.html">PartialCompliant</a>
  </td>
  <td>Compliant connection of two rotational 1-dim. flanges
                   (used for force laws such as a spring or a damper).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Interfaces.PartialCompliantWithRelativeStates.html">PartialCompliantWithRelativeStates</a>
  </td>
  <td> Same as "PartialCompliant", but relative angle and relative speed are
                    defined as preferred states. Use this partial model if the force law
                    needs anyway the relative speed. The advantage is that it is usually better
                    to use relative angles between drive train components
                    as states, especially, if the angle is not limited (e.g., as for drive trains
                    in vehicles).

<tr>
  <td><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Interfaces.PartialElementaryTwoFlangesAndSupport2.html">PartialElementaryTwoFlangesAndSupport2</a>
</td>
  <td> Partial model for a 1-dim. rotational gear consisting of the flange of
                    an input shaft, the flange of an output shaft and the support.
  </td>

<tr>
  <td><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Interfaces.PartialTorque.html">PartialTorque</a>
</td>
  <td> Partial model of a torque acting at the flange (accelerates the flange).
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Interfaces.PartialTwoFlanges.html">PartialTwoFlanges</a>
</td>
  <td>General connection of two rotational 1-dim. flanges.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Interfaces.PartialAbsoluteSensor.html">PartialAbsoluteSensor</a>
</td>
  <td>Measure absolute flange variables.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Interfaces.PartialRelativeSensor.html">PartialRelativeSensor</a>
</td>
  <td>Measure relative flange variables.
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The difference between these base classes are the auxiliary
variables defined in the model and the relations between
the flange variables already defined in the base class.
For example, in model <strong>PartialCompliant</strong> there is no
support flange, whereas in model
<strong>PartialElementaryTwoFlangesAndSupport2</strong>
there is a support flange.
</p>
<p>
The equations of a mechanical component are vector equations, i.e.,
they need to be expressed in a common coordinate system.
Therefore, for a component a <strong>local axis of rotation</strong> has to be
defined. All vector quantities, such as cut-torques or angular
velocities have to be expressed according to this definition.
Examples for such a definition are given in the following figure
for an inertia component and a planetary gearbox:
</p>

<p>
<img src="resources/Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.UsersGuide.UserDefinedComponents_info_001.png" alt="driveAxis">
</p>

<p>
As can be seen, all vectors are directed into the direction
of the rotation axis. The angles in the flanges are defined
correspondingly. For example, the angle <code>sun.phi</code> in the
flange of the sun wheel of the planetary gearbox is positive,
if rotated in mathematical positive direction (= counter clock
wise) along the axis of rotation.
</p>
<p>
On first view, one may assume that the selected local
coordinate system has an influence on the usage of the
component. But this is not the case, as shown in the next figure:
</p>

<p>
<img src="resources/Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.UsersGuide.UserDefinedComponents_info_002.png" alt="inertias">
</p>

<p>
In the figure the <strong>local</strong> axes of rotation of the components
are shown. The connection of two inertias in the left and in the
right part of the figure are completely equivalent, i.e., the right
part is just a different drawing of the left part. This is due to the
fact, that by a connection, the two local coordinate systems are
made identical and the (automatically) generated connection equations
(= angles are identical, cut-torques sum-up to zero) are also
expressed in this common coordinate system. Therefore, even if in
the left figure it seems to be that the angular velocity vector of
<code>J2</code> goes from right to left, in reality it goes from
left to right as shown in the right part of the figure, where the
local coordinate systems are drawn such that they are aligned.
Note, that the simple rule stated in section 4 (Sign conventions)
also determines that
the angular velocity of <code>J2</code> in the left part of the
figure is directed from left to right.
</p>
<p>
To summarize, the local coordinate system selected for a component
is just necessary, in order that the equations of this component
are expressed correctly. The selection of the coordinate system
is arbitrary and has no influence on the usage of the component.
Especially, the actual direction of, e.g., a cut-torque is most
easily determined by the rule of section 4. A more strict determination
by aligning coordinate systems and then using the vector direction
of the local coordinate systems, often requires a re-drawing of the
diagram and is therefore less convenient to use.
