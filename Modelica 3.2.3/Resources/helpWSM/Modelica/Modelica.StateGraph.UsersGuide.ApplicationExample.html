<p>
In this section a more realistic, still simple, application example
is given, to demonstrate various features of the StateGraph library.
This example shows the control of a two tank system from the master thesis
of Isolde Dressler
(<a href="Modelica.StateGraph.UsersGuide.Literature.html">see literature</a>).
</p>
<p>
In the following figure the top level of the model is shown.
This model is available as StateGraph.Examples.ControlledTanks.
</p>

<p>
In the right part of the figure, two tanks are shown. At the top part,
a large fluid source is present from which fluid can be filled in
<strong>tank1</strong> when <strong>valve1</strong> is open. Tank1 can be emptied via
<strong>valve2</strong> that is located in the bottom of tank2 and
fills a second <strong>tank2</strong> which in turn is emptied via
<strong>valve3</strong>. The actual levels of the tanks are measured
and are provided as signals <strong>level1</strong> and <strong>level2</strong>
to the <strong>tankController</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>tankController</strong> is controlled by three buttons,
<strong>start</strong>, <strong>stop</strong> and <strong>shut</strong> (for shutdown)
that are mutually exclusive. This means that whenever one button is
pressed (i.e., its state is <strong>true</strong>) then the other two
buttons are not pressed (i.e., their states are <strong>false</strong>).
When button <strong>start</strong> is pressed, the "normal" operation
to fill and to empty the two tanks is processed:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Valve 1 is opened and tank 1 is filled.</li>
<li> When tank 1 reaches its fill level limit,
     valve 1 is closed.</li>
<li> After a waiting time, valve 2 is
     opened and the fluid flows from tank 1 into tank 2.</li>
<li> When tank 1 is empty, valve 2 is closed.</li>
<li> After a waiting time, valve 3 is opened and
     the fluid flows out of tank 2</li>
<li> When tank 2 is empty, valve 3 is closed</li>
</ol>
<p>
The above "normal" process can be influenced by the following
buttons:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Button <strong>start</strong> starts the above process.
     When this button is pressed after a "stop" or
     "shut" operation, the process operation continues.
     </li>
<li> Button <strong>stop</strong> stops the above process by
     closing all valves. Then, the controller waits for
     further input (either "start" or "shut" operation).</li>
<li> Button <strong>shut</strong> is used to shutdown the process,
     by emptying at once both tanks. When this is achieved,
     the process goes back to its start configuration.
     Clicking on "start", restarts the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The implementation of the <strong>tankController</strong> is shown in
the next figure:
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
When the "<strong>start</strong>" button is pressed, the stateGraph is
within the CompositeStep "<strong>makeProduct</strong>". During normal
operation this CompositeStep is only left, once tank2 is empty.
Afterwards, the CompositeStep is at once re-entered.
</p>
<p>
When the "<strong>stop</strong>" button is pressed, the "makeProduct"
CompositeStep is at once terminated via the "<strong>suspend</strong>" port
and the stateGraph waits in step "<strong>s2</strong>" for further
commands. When the "<strong>start</strong>" button is pressed, the CompositeStep
is re-entered via its <strong>resume</strong> port and the "normal"
operation continues at the state where it was aborted by the
suspend transition. If the "<strong>shut</strong>" button is pressed,
the stateGraph waits in the "<strong>emptyTanks</strong>" step, until
both tanks are empty and then waits at the initial step
"<strong>s1</strong>" for further input.
</p>
<p>
The opening and closing of valves is <strong>not</strong> directly
defined in the stateGraph. Instead via the "<strong>setValveX</strong>"
components, the Boolean state of the valves are computed.
For example, the output y of "setValve2" is computed as:
</p>
<pre>
  y = makeProduct.fillTank2.active or emptyTanks.active
</pre>
<p>
i.e., valve2 is open, when step "makeProduct.fillTank2 or when
step "emptyTanks" is active. Otherwise, valve2 is closed.
