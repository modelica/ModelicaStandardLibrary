Pressure drop equations and other fluid characteristics are usually
computed by <strong>semi-empirical</strong> equations. Unfortunately, the developers
of semi-empirical equations nearly never take into account that the
equation might be used in a simulation program. As a consequence, these
semi-empirical equations can nearly never be used blindly but must
be slightly modified or adapted in order that obvious
simulation problems are avoided. Below, examples are given to
demonstrate what problems occur and how to regularize the characteristics:
</p>

<h4>Square root function</h4>
<p>
In several empirical formulae, expressions of the following form
are present, e.g., for turbulent flow in a pipe:
</p>
<pre>   y = <strong>if</strong> x &lt; 0 <strong>then</strong> -<strong>sqrt</strong>( <strong>abs</strong>(x) ) <strong>else</strong> <strong>sqrt</strong>(x)
</pre>
<p>
A plot of this characteristic is shown in the next figure:
</p>

</p>

<p>
The difficulty with this function is that the derivative at x=0 is infinity.
In reality, such a function does not exist. E.g., for pipe flow,
the flow becomes laminar for small velocities and therefore around zero the
sqrt() function is replaced by a linear function. Since the laminar region is
usually of not much practical interest, the above approximation is used.
</p>
<p>
The direct implementation above does not work in Modelica, because
an event is generated when x &lt; 0 changes sign. In order to detect
this event, an event iteration takes place. During the event iteration,
the active if-branch is not changed. For example, assume that x is positive
(= "else" branch) and shall become negative. During the event iteration
x is slightly negative and the else branch, i.e., sqrt(x), is evaluated.
Since this results in an imaginary number, an error occurs.
It would be possible to fix this, by using the <strong>noEvent</strong>() operator
to explicitly switch of an event:
</p>
<pre>   y = <strong>if</strong> <strong>noEvent</strong>(x &lt; 0) <strong>then</strong> -<strong>sqrt</strong>( <strong>abs</strong>(x) ) <strong>else</strong> <strong>sqrt</strong>(x)
</pre>
<p>
Still, it is highly likely that good integrators will not work well
around x=0, because they will recognize that the derivative changes very
sharply and will reduce the step size drastically.
</p>
<p>
There are several solutions around this problem: Around x=0, the sqrt() function
can be replaced by a polynomial of 3rd order which is determined in such a way
that it smoothly touches the sqrt() function, i.e., the whole function is continuous
and continuously differentiable. In the Modelica.Fluid library, implementations of
such critical functions are provided in sublibrary Modelica.Fluid.Utilities.
The above sqrt() type function is computed by function <strong>Utilities.regRoot</strong>().
This function is defined as:
</p>
<pre>     y := x/(x*x+delta*delta)^0.25;
</pre>
<p>
where "delta" is the size of the small region around zero where the
sqrt() function is approximated by another function. The plot of the
function above is practically identical to the one of the original function.
However, it has a finite derivative at x=0 and is differentiable up to
any order. With the default value of delta=0.01, the difference between
the function above and regRoot(x) is 16% around x=0.01, 0.25% around x=0.1
and 0.0025% around x=1.
