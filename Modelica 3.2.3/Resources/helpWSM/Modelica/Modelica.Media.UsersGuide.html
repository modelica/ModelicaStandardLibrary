<h1>Information</h1>
<div class="hideable">
<p class="aside">This information is part of the Modelica Standard Library maintained by the Modelica Association.</p>
<p>
Library <strong>Modelica.Media</strong> is a <strong>free</strong> Modelica package providing
a standardized interface to fluid media models and specific
media models based on this interface.
A fluid medium model defines <strong>algebraic</strong> equations
for the intensive thermodynamic variables used in the <strong>mass</strong>
and <strong>energy</strong> balance of component models. Optionally, additional
medium properties can be computed such as dynamic viscosity or thermal
conductivity. Medium models are defined for <strong>single</strong> and
<strong>multiple substance</strong> fluids with <strong>one</strong> and
<strong>multiple phases</strong>.
</p>
<p>
A large part of the library provides specific medium models
that can be directly utilized. This library can be used in
all types of Modelica fluid libraries that may have different connectors
and design philosophies. It is particularly utilized
in the Modelica_Fluid library (the Modelica_Fluid library is currently
under development to provide 1D therm-fluid flow components for
single and multiple substance flow with one and multiple phases).
The Modelica.Media library has the following
main features:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Balance equations and media model equations
     are decoupled.
     This means that the used medium model does usually not have an
     influence on how the balance equations are formulated.
     For example, the same balance equations are used for media
     that use pressure and temperature, or pressure and specific
     enthalpy as independent variables, as well as for
     incompressible and compressible media models.
     A Modelica tool will have enough information to
     generate as efficient code as a traditional
     (coupled) definition. This feature is described in more
     detail in section
     <a href="Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumDefinition.StaticStateSelection.html">Static State Selection</a>.</li>
<li> Optional variables, such as dynamic viscosity, are only computed if
     needed in the corresponding component.</li>
<li> The independent variables of a medium model do not
     influence the definition of a fluid connector port.
     Especially, the media models are implemented in such a way
     that a connector may have the minimum number of independent
     medium variables in a connector and still get the same
     efficiency as if all medium variables are passed by the
     connector from one component to the next one (the latter
     approach has the restriction that a fluid port can only
     connect two components and not more). Note, the Modelica_Fluid
     library uses the first approach, i.e., having a set of
     independent medium variables in a connector.</li>
<li> The medium models are implemented with regards to
     efficient dynamic simulation. For example, two phase
     medium models trigger state events at phase boundaries
     (because the medium variables are not differentiable
     at this point).</li>
</ul>
