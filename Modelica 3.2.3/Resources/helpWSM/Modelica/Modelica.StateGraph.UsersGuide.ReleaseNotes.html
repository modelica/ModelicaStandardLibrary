<p class="aside">This information is part of the Modelica Standard Library maintained by the Modelica Association.</p>
<h4>Version 0.87, 2004-06-23</h4>
<ul>
<li> Included in Modelica standard library 2.0 Beta 1 with the new block connectors.
     Changed all the references to the block connectors and the Logical library
     correspondingly.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 0.86, 2004-06-20</h4>
<ul>
<li> New components "Alternative" and "Parallel" for alternative and
     parallel execution paths.</li>
<li> A step has now a vector of input and output connectors in order
     that multiple connections to and from a step are possible</li>
<li> Removed components "AlternativeSplit", "AlternativeJoin",
     "ParallelSplit" and "ParallelJoin" since the newly introduced
     components ("Alternative", "Parallel", vector connectors of steps)
     have the same modeling power but are safer and more convenient.</li>
<li> Removed the timer in a step (attach instead Logical.Timer to
     the "active" port of a "StepWithSignal" component). Note, that in
     most cases it is more convenient and more efficient to use the
     built-in timer of a transition.</li>
<li> Component "StepInitial" renamed to "InitialStep".</li>
<li> New component "Timer" within sublibrary Logical.</li>
<li> Updated and improved documentation of the library.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 0.85, 2004-06-17</h4>
<ul>
<li> Renamed "MacroStep" to "CompositeStep" and the ports of the MacroStep
     from "abort" to "suspend" and "history" to "resume".</li>
<li> Nested "CompositeStep" components are supported, based on the
     experimental feature of nested inner/outer components
     introduced by Dymola. This means that CompositeSteps can
     be suspended and resumed at every level.</li>
<li> New example "Examples.ShowExceptions" to demonstrate the new
     feature of nested CompositeSteps.</li>
<li> New package "Logical". It contains all components of
     ModelicaAdditions.Blocks.Logical, but with new block connectors
     and nicer icons. Additionally, logical blocks are also added.</li>
<li> Improved icons for several components of the StateGraph library.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 0.83, 2004-05-21</h4>
<ul>
<li> The "abort" and "history" connectors are no longer visible in the
     diagram layer of a CompositeStep since it is not allowed to connect
     to them in a CompositeStep.</li>
<li> Made the diagram/icon size of a CompositeStep smaller (from 200/-200 to
     150/-150).</li>
<li> Improved icons for "SetBoolean/SetInteger/SetReal" components.</li>
<li> Renamed "ParameterReal" to "SetRealParameter".</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 0.82, 2004-05-18</h4>
<p>
Implemented a first version that is provided to other people.
