<p>
If pressure p and specific enthalpy h are <strong>not</strong> used as
independent medium variables, the specific enthalpy should
be computed by a Modelica function that has as input arguments
only the independent medium variables. It should <strong>not</strong> be
computed by an equation. For example, if p and T are used
as independent medium variables, a function h_pT(p,T) should
be defined that is called to compute h:
</p>

<pre>
    h = h_pT(p,T);
</pre>

<p>
The reason for this rule requires a longer explanation.
In short, if h is not a computed by a Modelica function and
this function is non-linear in the independent medium variables,
then non-linear systems of equations will occur at
every connection point, if the FluidPort connectors from the
Modelica_Fluid library are used (these are the same as in
Modelica.Media.Examples.Utilities.FluidPort).
Only, if the above rule is fulfilled, a tool is able to
remove these non-linear system of equations in most cases.
</p>

<p>
The basic idea of the FluidPort connector is that 2 or more
components can be connected together at a point and that
automatically the mass and energy balance is fulfilled
in the connection point, i.e., the ideal mixing equations
are generated. Note, the momentum balance is only correct for
straight line connections. If "ideal mixing" is not sufficient,
a special component to define the mixing equations must be introduced.
</p>

<p>
The mass and momentum balance equations in a component are
derived from the partial differential equations along the
flow direction of a pipe:
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Note, F<sub>F</sub> is the fanning friction factor.
The energy balance can be given in different forms.
Usually, it is given as:
</p>

<p>
<img src="modelica:///Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumDefinition.SpecificEnthalpyAsFunction/resources/Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumDefinition.SpecificEnthalpyAsFunction_info_002.png">
</p>

<p>
This form describes the change of the internal energy, kinetic
energy and potential energy of a volume as function of the
in and out flowing fluid. Multiplying the momentum balance
with the flow velocity v and subtracting it from the energy
balance above, results in the following alternative form
of the energy balance:
</p>

<p>
<img src="modelica:///Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumDefinition.SpecificEnthalpyAsFunction/resources/Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumDefinition.SpecificEnthalpyAsFunction_info_003.png">
</p>

<p>
This form has the advantage that the kinetic and potential
energy is no longer part of the energy balance and therefore
the energy balance is substantially simpler (e.g., additional non-linear
systems of equations occur in the first form since the velocity
is present in the energy balance; in the second form this is not
the case and it is still valid also for high speeds).
</p>

<p>
Assume now that the second form of the energy balance above
is used in all components and that the following FluidPort connector
is used in all components:
</p>

<pre>
<strong>connector</strong> FluidPort
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
  Medium.AbsolutePressure      p;
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.MassFlowRate     m_flow;

  Medium.SpecificEnthalpy      h;
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.EnthalpyFlowRate H_flow;

  Medium.MassFraction          Xi    [Medium.nXi];
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.MassFlowRate     mX_flow[Medium.nXi];
<strong>end</strong> FluidPort;
</pre>

<p>
As an example, assume that 3 components
are connected together and that the medium is a single substance
fluid. This will result in the following
connection equations:
</p>

<pre>
    p1=p2=p3;
    h1=h2=h3;
    0 = m_flow1 + m_flow2 + m_flow3;
    0 = H_flow1 + H_flow2 + H_flow3;
</pre>

<p>
These are the mass balance and the
energy balance (form 2) of an infinitesimal volume
in the connection point under the assumption that no
mass or energy is stored in this volume. In other words,
the connection equations are the equations that describe
ideal mixing. Under the assumption that the velocity
vectors of the 3 flows are identical (especially, they are
parallel), also the momentum balance is fulfilled:
</p>

<pre>
   0 = m_flow1*v1 + m_flow2*v2 + m_flow3*v3;
     = v*(m_flow1 + m_flow2 + m_flow3);
     = 0;
</pre>

<p>
With the above connector it is therefore possible to
connect components together in a nearly arbitrary fashion,
because every connection fulfills automatically the
balance equations. This approach has, however, one drawback:
If two components are connected together, then the medium
variables on both sides of the connector are identical.
However, due to the connector, only the two equations
</p>

<pre>
   p1 = p2;
   h1 = h2;
</pre>

<p>
are present. Assume, that p,T are the independent medium variables
and that the medium properties are computed at one side of the
connections. This means, the following equations are basically
present:
</p>

<pre>
    h1 = h(p1,T1);
    h2 = h(p2,T2);
    p1 = p2;
    h1 = h2;
</pre>

<p>
These equations can be solved in the following way:
</p>

<pre>
    h1 := h(p1,T1)
    p2 := p1;
    h2 := h1;
    0  := h2 - h(p2,T2);   // non-linear system of equations for T2
</pre>

<p>
This means that T2 is computed by solving a non-linear system
of equations. If h1 and h2 are provided as Modelica functions,
a Modelica translator can replace
this non-linear system of equations by the equation:
</p>

<pre>
   T2 := T1;
</pre>

<p>
because after alias substitution there are two function calls
</p>

<pre>
    h1 := h(p1,T1);
    h1 := h(p1,T2);
</pre>

<p>
Since the left hand side of the function call and the first
argument are the same, the second arguments T1 and T2 must also be
identical and therefore T2 := T1. This type of analysis seems
to be only possible, if the specific enthalpy is defined as a function
of the independent medium variables.
