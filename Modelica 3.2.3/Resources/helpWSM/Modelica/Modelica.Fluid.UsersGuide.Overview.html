<p class="aside">This information is part of the Modelica Standard Library maintained by the Modelica Association.</p>
<p>
The Modelica.Fluid library provides basic interfaces and
components to model 1-dimensional thermo-fluid flow in networks of pipes.
It is not the intention that this library covers all
application cases because the fluid flow area is too large and
because for special applications it is possible to implement
libraries with simpler component interfaces.
Instead, the goal is that the Modelica.Fluid library provides
a <strong>reasonable set of components</strong> and that it <strong>demonstrates</strong>
how to implement components of a fluid flow library in Modelica,
in particular to cope with difficult issues such as connector
design, reversing flow and initialization. It is planned to
include more components in the future. User proposals are
welcome.
</p>
<p>
This library has the following main features:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The connectors Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort_a/_b are designed
     for one-dimensional flow of a <strong>single substance</strong>
     or of a <strong>mixture of substances</strong> with optional <strong>multiple phases</strong>.
     All media models from Modelica.Media can be utilized when
     connecting components. For one substance media, the additional arrays for
     multiple
     substance media have zero dimension and are therefore removed
     from the code during translation. The general connector definition
     therefore does not introduce an overhead for special cases.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> All the components of the Modelica.Fluid library are designed
     that they can be utilized for all media models from
     Modelica.Media if this is possible. For example, all media can
     be utilized for the Modelica.Fluid.Sensors/Sources components.
     For some components only special media are possible, since additional
     functionality is required. For example,
     Modelica.Fluid.Components.Evaporator requires a two phase medium
     (extending from Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialTwoPhaseMedium).
     <br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> In order to simplify the initialization in the components,
     there is the restriction that only media models are supported
     that have T, (p,T), (p,h), (T,X), (p,T,X) or (p,h,X) as
     independent variables. Other media models would be possible,
     e.g., with (T,d) as independent variables. However, this requires
     to rewrite the code for the component initialization.
     (Note, T is temperature, p is pressure, d is density,
     h is specific enthalpy, and X is a mass fraction vector).
     <br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> All components work for <strong>incompressible</strong> and <strong>compressible</strong> media.
     This is implemented by a small change in the initialization of a
     component, if the medium is incompressible. Otherwise, the equations
     of the components are not influenced by this property.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> All components allow fluid flow in both directions, i.e.,
     <strong>reversing flow</strong> is supported. However, it is possible to declare that
     the flow through a component only has the design direction, in order to
     obtain faster simulation code.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> Two or more components can be connected together. This means that
     the pressures of all connected ports are equal and the mass flow rates
     sum up to zero. Specific enthalpy, mass fractions and trace substances are
     mixed according to the mass flow rates.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> The <strong>momentum balance</strong> and the <strong>energy balance</strong> are only fulfilled exactly if
     <strong>two ports of equal diameter</strong> are connected. In all other cases, the balances
     are approximated, because kinetic and friction effect are neglected. An explicit fitting
     or junction should be used if these are important for the specific problem at hand.
     In all circuits where friction dominates, or components such as pumps determine the flow rate,
     kinetic pressure is typically irrelevant. You can consider the
     <a href="Modelica.Fluid.Examples.Explanatory.MomentumBalanceFittings.html">Modelica.Fluid.Examples.Explanatory.MomentumBalanceFittings</a> model (and its documentation)
     to see one case where the momentum balance essentially depends on kinetic pressure,
     so it is necessary to use explicit fittings in order to obtain correct results.
     <br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> Given the above-mentioned limitations, there is no restriction how components can be connected
     together. The resulting simulation performance however often strongly depends on the
     model structure and modeling assumptions made. In particular the direct connection of
     fluid volumes generally results in high-index DAEs for the pressures. The direct
     connection of flow models generally results in systems of implicit nonlinear algebraic
     equations.<br>&nbsp;</li>
