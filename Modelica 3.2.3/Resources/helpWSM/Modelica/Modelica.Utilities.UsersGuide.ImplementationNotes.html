<p class="aside">This information is part of the Modelica Standard Library maintained by the Modelica Association.</p>
<p>
Below the major design decisions of this library are summarized.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>C-Function Interface</strong><br>
     This library contains several interfaces to C-functions in order
     to operate with the environment. As will become clear, it is usually
     required that a Modelica tool vendor provides an implementation
     of these C-functions that are suited for his environment.
     In directory "Modelica/Resources/C-Sources" a reference implementation
     is given for Microsoft Windows Systems and for POSIX environments.
     The files "ModelicaInternal.c" and "ModelicaStrings.c" can be
     used as a basis for the integration in the vendors environment.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> <strong>Character Encoding</strong><br>
     The representation of characters is different in operating systems.
     The more modern ones (e.g., Windows-NT) use an early variant of
     Unicode (16 bit per character)
     other (e.g., Windows-ME) use 8-bit encoding. Also 32 bit per character
     and multi-byte representations are in use. This is important, since e.g.,
     Japanese Modelica users need Unicode representation. The design in this
     library is done in such a way that a basic set of calls to the operating
     system hides the actual character representation. This means, that all
     functions of this package can be used independent from the underlying
     character representation.<br>
     The C-interface of the Modelica language provides only an 8-bit
     character encoding passing mechanism of strings. As a result, the
     reference implementation in "Modelica.Utilities\C-Source" needs to
     be adapted to the character representation supported in the
     Modelica vendor environment.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> <strong>Internal String Representation</strong><br>
     The design of this package was made in order that string handling
     is convenient. This is in contrast to, e.g., the C-language, where
     string handling is inconvenient, cumbersome and error prone, but on the
     other hand is in some sense "efficient".
     The standard reference implementation in "Modelica.Utilities\C-Source"
     is based on the standard C definition of a string, i.e., a pointer to
     a sequence of characters, ended with a null terminating character.
     In order that the string handling in this package is convenient,
     some assumptions have been made, especially, that the access to
     a substring is efficient (O(1) access instead of O(n) as in standard C).
     This allows to hide string pointer arithmetic from the user.
     In such a case, a similar efficiency as in C can be expected for
     most high level operations, such as find, sort, replace.
     The "efficient character access" can be reached if, e.g.,
     the number of characters
     are stored in a string, and the length of a character is fixed,
     say 16 or 32 bit (if all Unicode characters shall be represented).
     A vendor should adapt the reference implementation in this
     respect.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> <strong>String copy = pointer copy</strong><br>
     The Modelica language has no mechanism to change a character
     of a string. When a string has to be modified, the only way
     to achieve this is to generate it newly. The advantage is that
     a Modelica tool can treat a string as a constant entity and
     can replace (expensive) string copy operations by pointer
     copy operations. For example, when sorting a set of strings
     the following type of operations occur:
     <pre>
     String s[:], s_temp;
      ...
     s_temp := s[i];
     s[i]   := s[j];
     s[j]   := s_temp;
     </pre>
     Formally, three strings are copied. Due to the feature
     sketched above, a Modelica tool can replace this
     copy operation by pointer assignments, a very "cheap"
     operation. The Modelica.Utilities functions will perform
     efficiently, if such types of optimizations are supported
     by the tool.</li>
