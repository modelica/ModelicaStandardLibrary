<h4>Basic usage of medium model</h4>
<p>
Media models in Modelica.Media are provided by packages, inheriting from the
partial package Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium. Every package defines:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Medium <strong>constants</strong> (such as the number of chemical substances,
     molecular data, critical properties, etc.).</li>
<li> A BaseProperties <strong>model</strong>, to compute the basic thermodynamic
     properties of the fluid;</li>
<li> <strong>setState_XXX</strong> functions to compute the thermodynamic state record from
     different input arguments (such as density, temperature, and composition which
     would be setState_dTX);</li>
<li> <strong>Functions</strong> to compute additional properties (such as saturation
     properties, viscosity, thermal conductivity, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are - as stated above - two different basic ways of using the Media library which
will be described in more details in the following section. One way is to use the model BaseProperties.
Every instance of BaseProperties for any medium model provides <strong>3+nXi
equations</strong> for the following <strong>5+nXi variables</strong> that are declared in
the medium model (nXi is the number of independent mass fractions, see
explanation below):
</p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
  <tr><td><strong>Variable</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Unit</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>T</td>
      <td>K</td>
      <td>temperature</td></tr>
  <tr><td>p</td>
      <td>Pa</td>
      <td>absolute pressure</td></tr>
  <tr><td>d</td>
      <td>kg/m3</td>
      <td>density</td></tr>
  <tr><td>u</td>
      <td>J/kg</td>
      <td>specific internal energy</td></tr>
  <tr><td>h</td>
      <td>J/kg</td>
      <td>specific enthalpy (h = u + p/d)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Xi[nXi]</td>
      <td>kg/kg</td>
      <td>independent mass fractions m_i/m</td></tr>
  <tr><td>X[nX]</td>
      <td>kg/kg</td>
      <td>All mass fractions m_i/m. X is defined in BaseProperties by:<br>
          X = <strong>if</strong> reducedX <strong>then</strong> vector([Xi; 1-<strong>sum</strong>(Xi)])
          <strong>else</strong> Xi </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<strong>Two</strong> variables out of p, d, h, or u, as well as the
<strong>mass fractions</strong> Xi are the <strong>independent</strong> variables and the
medium model basically provides equations to compute
the remaining variables, including the full mass fraction vector X
(more details to Xi and X are given further below).
</p>
<p>
In a component, the most basic usage of a medium model is as follows
</p>
<pre>
  <strong>model</strong> Pump
    <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
                         "Medium model" <strong>annotation</strong> (choicesAllMatching = <strong>true</strong>);
    Medium.BaseProperties medium_a "Medium properties at location a (e.g., port_a)";
    // Use medium variables (medium_a.p, medium_a.T, medium_a.h, ...)
     ...
  <strong>end</strong> Pump;
</pre>
<p>
The second way is to use the setState_XXX functions to compute the thermodynamic state
record from which all other thermodynamic state variables can be computed (see
<a href="Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumDefinition.BasicDefinition.html">
Basic definition of medium</a> for further details on ThermodynamicState). The setState_XXX functions
accept either X or Xi (see explanation below) and will decide internally which of these two compositions
is provided by the user. The four fundamental setState_XXX functions are provided in PartialMedium
</p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
  <tr><td><strong>Function</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Short-form for<br>single component medium</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>setState_dTX</td>
      <td>computes ThermodynamicState from density, temperature, and composition X or Xi</td>
      <td>setState_dT</td></tr>
  <tr><td>setState_phX</td>
      <td>computes ThermodynamicState from pressure, specific enthalpy, and composition X or Xi</td>
      <td>setState_ph</td></tr>
  <tr><td>setState_psX</td>
      <td>computes ThermodynamicState from pressure, specific entropy, and composition X or Xi</td>
      <td>setState_ps</td></tr>
  <tr><td>setState_pTX</td>
      <td>computes ThermodynamicState from pressure, temperature, and composition X or Xi</td>
      <td>setState_pT</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The simple example that explained the basic usage of BaseProperties would then become
</p>
<pre>
  <strong>model</strong> Pump
    <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
                         "Medium model" <strong>annotation</strong> (choicesAllMatching = <strong>true</strong>);
    Medium.ThermodynamicState state_a "Thermodynamic state record at location a (e.g., port_a)";
    // Compute medium variables from thermodynamic state record (pressure(state_a), temperature(state_a),
    // specificEnthalpy(state_a), ...)
    ...
  <strong>end</strong> Pump;
</pre>
<p>
All media models are directly or indirectly a subpackage of package
Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium. Therefore,
a medium model in a component should inherit from this
partial package. Via the annotation "choicesAllMatching = true" it
is defined that the tool should display a selection box with
all loaded packages that inherit from PartialMedium. An example
is given in the next figure:
</p>

<p>
<img src="resources/Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumUsage.BasicUsage_info_001.png" alt="medium selection menu">
</p>

<p>
A selected medium model leads, e.g., to the following equation:
</p>
<pre>
  Pump pump(<strong>redeclare package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Water.SimpleLiquidWater);
</pre>
<p>
Usually, a medium model is associated with the variables of a
fluid connector. Therefore, equations have to be defined in a model
that relate the variables in the connector with the variables
in the medium model:
</p>
<pre>
  <strong>model</strong> Pump
    <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
                         "Medium model" <strong>annotation</strong> (choicesAllMatching = <strong>true</strong>);
    Medium.BaseProperties medium_a "Medium properties of port_a";
    // definition of the fluid port port_a
     ...
  <strong>equation</strong>
    medium.p = port_a.p;
    medium.h = port_a.h;
    medium.Xi = port_a.Xi;
     ...
  <strong>end</strong> Pump;
</pre>
in the case of using BaseProperties or
<pre>
  <strong>model</strong> Pump
    <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
                         "Medium model" <strong>annotation</strong> (choicesAllMatching = <strong>true</strong>);
    Medium.ThermodynamicState state_a "Thermodynamic state record of medium at port_a";
    // definition of the fluid port port_a
     ...
  <strong>equation</strong>
    state_a = Medium.setState_phX(port_a.p, port_a.h, port_a.Xi) // if port_a contains the variables
                                                                 // p, h, and Xi
     ...
  <strong>end</strong> Pump;
</pre>
<p>
in the case of using ThermodynamicState.
</p>
<p>
If a component model shall treat both single and multiple
substance fluids, equations for the mass fractions have to be
present (above: medium.Xi = port_a.Xi) in the model. According
to the Modelica semantics, the equations of the mass fractions
are ignored, if the dimension of Xi is zero, i.e., for a single-component
medium. Note, by specific techniques sketched in section
"Medium definition", the independent variables in the medium model
need not to be the same as the variables in the connector and still
get the same efficiency, as if the same variables would be used.
</p>

<p>
If a fluid consists of a single
substance, <strong>nXi = 0</strong> and the vector of mass fractions Xi is not
present. If a fluid consists of nS substances,
the medium model may define the number of independent
mass fractions <strong>nXi</strong> to be <strong>nS</strong>, <strong>nS-1</strong>, or zero.
In all cases, balance equations for nXi substances have to be
given in the corresponding component (see discussion below).
Note, that if nXi = nS, the constraint "sum(Xi)=1" between the mass
fractions is <strong>not</strong> present in the model; in that case, it is necessary to
provide consistent start values for Xi such that sum(Xi) = 1.
</p>

<p>
The reason for this definition of Xi is that a fluid component library
can be implemented by using only the independent mass fractions Xi and
then via the medium it is defined how Xi is interpreted:
</p>

<ul>
<li> If Xi = nS, then the constraint equation sum(X) = 1 is neglected
     during simulation. By making sure that the initial conditions of X
     fulfill this constraint, it can usually be guaranteed that small
     errors in sum(X) = 1 remain small although this constraint equation is
     not explicitly used during the simulation. This approach is usually useful
     if components of the mixture can become very small. If such a small
     quantity is computed via the equation 1 - sum(X[1:nX-1]), there might
     be large numerical errors and it is better to compute it via
     the corresponding balance equation.</li>
<li> If Xi = nS-1, then the true independent mass fractions are used
     in the fluid component and the last component of X is computed via
     X[nX] = 1 - sum(Xi). This is useful for, e.g., MoistAir, where the
     number of states should be as small as possible without introducing
     numerical problems.</li>
<li> If Xi = 0, then the reference value of composition reference_X is
     assumed. This case is useful to avoid composition states in all
     the cases when the composition will always be constant, e.g., with
     circuits having fixed composition sources.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The full vector of mass fractions <strong>X[nX]</strong> is computed in
PartialMedium.BaseProperties based on Xi, reference_X, and the information whether Xi = nS or nS-1. For single-substance media, nX = 0, so there's also no X vector. For multiple-substance media, nX = nS, and X always contains the full vector of mass fractions. In order to reduce confusion for the user of a fluid component library, "Xi" has the annotation "HideResult=true", meaning, that this variable is not shown in the plot window. Only X is shown in the plot window and this vector always contains all mass fractions.
