<p>
In this section the design of the fluid connectors is
explained.
</p>
<p>
Fluid connectors represent the points in a device (e.g., the
flanges) through which a fluid can flow into or out of the component, carrying its
thermodynamic properties; these flanges are assumed to be fixed in space.
</p>
<p>
A major design goal is that components can be arbitrarily
connected and that the important balance equations are automatically
fulfilled when 2 or more components are connected together at
one point as shown in the next figure:
</p>

<p>

     alt="MixingConnections.png">
</p>

<p>
In such a case the balance equations define <strong>ideal mixing</strong>,
i.e., the upstream discretization scheme of each component uses
values that result from ideal mixing in
an infinitely small time period. If more realistic modelling
is desired that takes into account mixing losses, an explicit
model has to be used in the connection point.
</p>
<h4>Single substance media</h4>
<p>
For a single substance medium, the connector definition in
Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort reduces to
</p>
<pre>
  <strong>connector</strong> FluidPort
     <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
              "Medium model of the fluid";
     <strong>flow</strong> Medium.MassFlowRate m_flow;
              "Mass flow rate from the connection point into the component";
     Medium.AbsolutePressure p
              "Thermodynamic pressure in the connection point";
     <strong>stream</strong> Medium.SpecificEnthalpy h_outflow
               "Specific thermodynamic enthalpy close to the connection point if m_flow &lt; 0";
  <strong>end</strong> FluidPort;
</pre>
<p>
The first statement defines the Medium flowing through the connector.
In a medium, medium specific types such as "Medium.AbsolutePressure"
are defined that contain medium specific values for the min, max and
nominal attributes. Furthermore, Medium.MassFlowRate is defined as:
</p>
<pre>
   <strong>type</strong> MassFlowRate =
      Modelica.SIunits.MassFlowRate(quantity="MassFlowRate." + mediumName);
</pre>
<p>
With the current library design, it is necessary to explicitly select the medium
model for each component in a circuit. This model is then propagated to the ports,
and a Modelica translator will check that the quantity and unit attributes
of connected interfaces are identical. Therefore, an error occurs,
if connected FluidPorts do not have a medium with the same medium name.
In the future, automatic propagation of fluid models through the ports will be
introduced, but this still not possible with Modelica 3.0.
</p>
<p>
The thermodynamic pressure is an <em>effort</em> variable, which means that the connection
of two or more ports states that the port pressures are the same.
</p>
<p>
The mass flow rate is a <em>flow</em> variable, which means that the connection of two or
more ports states that the sum of all flow rates is zero.
</p>
<p>
The last variable is a <em>stream</em> variable, i.e., a specific quantity carried by the
flow variable. The quantity on the connector always
corresponds to the value close to the connection point, assuming that the fluid is
flowing out of the connector, regardless of the actual direction of the flow. This helps
avoiding singularities when the mass flow goes through zero. The stream properties for the
other flow direction can be inquired with the built-in operator inStream(..), while the
value of the stream variable corresponding to the actual flow direction can be inquired
through the built-in operator actualStream(..).
</p>
<p>
The actual equations corresponding to these operators are introduced and solved automatically
by the tool. In principle, they correspond to the balance equation
sum(flow_variable) = 0 and sum(flow_variable*stream_variable_at_connection) = 0 applied to the set of connected ports. In this case the first equation is the mass balance sum(m_flow) = 0, and the second is the energy balance at the connection point sum(m_flow*h_connection) = 0.
</p>
<p>
In the simpler case of a one-to-one connections between port_a and port_b,
inStream(port_a.h_outflow) just returns port_b.h_outflow. For multiple-way connections,
mixing equations are generated, and special care is taken in order to avoid discontinuities
around zero flow rates. For more details, see this
<a href="resources/Modelica.Fluid.UsersGuide.ComponentDefinition.FluidConnectors_info_002.pdf">presentation</a>
which illustrates the stream concept rationale and the underlying technicalities.
</p>

<p>
A connector should have only the minimal number of variables to
describe the interface, otherwise there will be connection
restrictions in certain cases. Therefore, in the connector
no redundant variables are present, e.g., the temperature T
is not present because it can be computed from the connector
variables pressure p and specific enthalpy h.
</p>

<p>
Here are two simple examples to illustrate modeling with stream connectors. The first
one is a rigid adiabatic volume mixing two flows, where the kinetic and gravitational
terms in the energy balance are neglected for simplicity.
</p>

<pre>
model MixingVolume "Volume that mixes two flows"
  replaceable package Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialPureSubstance;
  FluidPort port_a, port_b;
  parameter Modelica.SIunits.Volume V "Volume of device";
  Modelica.SIunits.Mass             m "Mass in device";
  Modelica.SIunits.Energy           U "Inner energy in device";
  Medium.BaseProperties medium(preferredMediumStates=true) "Medium in the device";
equation
  // Definition of port variables
  port_a.p         = medium.p;
  port_b.p         = medium.p;
  port_a.h_outflow = medium.h;  // The stream variable always corresponds to the
  port_b.h_outflow = medium.h;  // properties of the fluid holdup (outgoing flow)

  // Total quantities
  m = V*medium.d;
  U = m*medium.u;
   // Mass and energy balance (actualStream(..) is a built-in operator for streams to
  // compute the right h, depending on the flow direction)
  der(m) = port_a.m_flow + port_b.m_flow;
  der(U) = port_a.m_flow*actualStream(port_a.h_outflow) +
           port_b.m_flow*actualStream(port_b.h_outflow);
end MixingVolume;
</pre>

<p>
The second example is the model of a component describing a lumped pressure loss
between two ports, with no energy storage and no heat transfer. An isenthalpic
transformation is assumed (changes in kinetic and potential energy between
inlet and outlet are neglected)
</p>
<pre>
model PressureLoss "Pressure loss component"
  replaceable package Medium=Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialPureSubstance;
  FluidPort port_a, port_b:
  Medium.ThermodynamicState port_a_state_inflow "State at port_a if inflowing";
  Medium.ThermodynamicState port_b_state_inflow "State at port_b if inflowing";
  Medium density d_a, d_b "Density at ports a and b if inflowing";
  replaceable function f "Function to compute the mass flow rate";
equation
  // Medium states for inflowing fluid
  port_a_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_a.p, inStream(port_a.h_outflow));
  port_b_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_b.p, inStream(port_b.h_outflow));
  // Mass balance
  0 = port_a.m_flow + port_b.m_flow;
  // Instantaneous propagation of enthalpy flow between the ports with
  // isenthalpic state transformation (no storage and no loss of energy)
  port_a.h_outflow = inStream(port_b.h_outflow);
  port_b.h_outflow = inStream(port_a.h_outflow);
  // (Regularized) Momentum balance
  port_a.m_flow = f(port_a.p, port_b.p, d_a, d_b);
end PressureLoss;
</pre>

<p>
If many such components are connected in series between two models with storage, the
specific enthalpies are propagated in both directions and available to all pressure
loss components, without problems when the mass flow goes through zero. The function
f then uses either d_a or d_b depending on the sign of port_a.p-port_b.p, with a
suitable regularization around zero to avoid discontinuities.
</p>

<p>
Please note that these models are highly idealized in order to explain the stream connector
concept. Device models in the library are much more complete, handling issues such as
initialization, steady vs. dynamic modelling, heat transfer from the outside, etc.
</p>

<h4>Multiple-substance media</h4>
<p>
Modelica.Fluid can handle models where the fluid contains multiple substances, so that its
composition can be characterized by mass fraction vectors.
</p>
<pre>
<strong>connector</strong> FluidPort
   <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
      "Medium model of the fluid";
   <strong>flow</strong> Medium.MassFlowRate m_flow;
      "Mass flow rate from the connection point into the component"
   Medium.AbsolutePressure p
      "Thermodynamic pressure in the connection point";
   <strong>stream</strong> Medium.SpecificEnthalpy h_outflow
       "Specific thermodynamic enthalpy close to the connection point if m_flow &lt; 0";
   <strong>stream</strong> Medium.MassFraction Xi_outflow[Medium.nXi]
       "Independent mixture mass fractions m_i/m close to the connection point if m_flow &lt; 0";
   <strong>stream</strong> Medium.ExtraProperty C_outflow[Medium.nC]
       "Properties c_i/m close to the connection point if m_flow &lt; 0";
  <strong>end</strong> FluidPort;
</pre>
The mass fraction vectors Xi and C are also stream quantities, as they are carried by the mass
flow rate. The corresponding connection equations are sum(m_flow*Xi) and sum(m_flow*C), which correspond to mass balances for the single substances. The vector Xi contains the mass fractions
of the main components of the fluid, and is used together with p and h to determine the
thermodynamic state of the fluid. The vector C contains the mass fraction of the trace components,
which are accounted for in mass balances, but is ignored when computing the fluid properties. This
allows to easily declare and use medium models with trace components starting from existing medium
models (e.g., adding CO<sub>2</sub> traces to Moist Air for air conditioning models).

<h4>Approximations in balance equations at connection point</h4>
<p>
Summing up, when two or more ports of the type FluidPort are connected, the following
equations are generated by the tool:
</p>
<pre>
sum(port_j.m_flow) = 0;               // Total Mass balance
port_j = port_k;                      // Momentum balance
sum(port_j.m_flow*h_connection) = 0;  // Energy balance
sum(port_j.m_flow*Xi_connection) = 0; // Single component mass balances
sum(port_j.m_flow*C_connection) = 0;  // Trace components mass balances
</pre>
<p>
It is <strong>very important</strong> to bear in mind that
</p>
<ul>
<li> the mass balances are always exact;</li>
<li> the momentum and energy balance are only exact when two port with the same
diameter are connected, because there is no friction and no change in fluid velocity.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In all other cases, i.e., different port diameters and/or multiple port connections:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The momentum balance does not consider friction effects and changes of pressure due to changes
in velocity.</li>
<li> There might thus be errors in the momentum balance of the order of magnitude
of the dynamic pressure &rho;v<sup>2</sup>/2.</li>
<li> The energy balance does not consider the kinetic terms (gravity terms cancel out due
to the infinitesimal size of the connection volume). There might thus be errors in the momentum balance of the order of magnitude of the kinetic energy v^2/2.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In many applications, where fluid speeds are low and thermal phenomena are mainly of interest,
these approximations are commonly made and lead to acceptable results.
In all other cases, explicit fitting and junction models should be used, that model explicitly
all the kinetic phenomena with the appropriate level of detail.
