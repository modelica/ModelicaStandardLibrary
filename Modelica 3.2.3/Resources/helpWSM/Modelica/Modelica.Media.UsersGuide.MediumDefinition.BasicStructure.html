<p>
A medium model of Modelica.Media is essentially a <strong>package</strong>
that contains the following definitions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Definition of <strong>constants</strong>, such as the medium name.</li>
<li>
A <strong>model</strong> in the package that contains the 3 basic
thermodynamic equations that relate the 5+nXi primary medium variables.</li>
<li><strong>Optional functions</strong> to compute medium properties that are
only needed in certain circumstances, such as dynamic viscosity. These optional
functions need not be provided by every medium model.</li>
<li>
<strong>Type</strong> definitions, which are adapted to the particular
medium. For example, a type <strong>Temperature</strong> is defined where the attributes
<strong>min</strong>
and <strong>max</strong> define the validity region of the medium, and a suitable default
start value is given. In a device model, it is advisable to use these type
definitions, e.g., for parameters, in order that medium limits are checked as
early as possible, and that iteration variables of non-linear
systems of equations get reasonable start values.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note, although we use the term <strong>medium model</strong>, it
is actually a Modelica <strong>package</strong> that contains all the constants and
definitions required for a complete <strong>medium model</strong>. The basic interface to a
medium is defined by Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium that has the
following structure:</p>
<pre>

<p>
We will discuss all parts of this package in the
following paragraphs. An actual medium model should extend from PartialMedium
and has to provide implementations of the various parts.
</p>

<p>
Some of the constants at the beginning of the package do not have a value yet
(this is valid in Modelica), but a value has to be provided when extending from
package PartialMedium. A given value can be modified until the model is
translated or the <strong>final</strong> prefix is set.
The reason to use constants instead of parameters in the model BaseProperties
is that some of these constants are used in a context where parameters
are not allowed. For example, in connector definitions the
number of independent mass fractions nXi is used as dimension
of a vector Xi. When defining the
connector, only <em>constants</em> in packages can be accessed, but not
<em>parameters</em> in a model, because a connector cannot contain an instance
of BaseProperties.
</p>

<p>The record BasePropertiesRecord contains the variables
primarily used in balance equations. Three equations for these variables have
to be provided by every medium in model BaseProperties, plus two equations
for the gas constant and the molar mass.
</p>

<p>Optional medium properties are defined by functions, such as the function
dynamicViscosity (see code Section above) to compute the dynamic viscosity.
The argument of those functions is the ThermodynamicState record, defined
in BaseProperties, which contains the minimum number of thermodynamic variables
needed as an input to compute all the optional properties.
This construction simplifies the usage
considerably as demonstrated in the following code fragment:
</p>

<pre>
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
  Medium.BaseProperties   medium;
  Medium.DynamicViscosity eta;
  ...
  U   = m*medium.u; //Internal energy
  eta = Medium.dynamicViscosity(medium.state);
</pre>

<p>Medium is the medium package that satisfies the
requirements of a PartialMedium (when using the model above, a value for
Medium has to be provided by a redeclaration). The medium component is an
instance of the model Medium.BaseProperties and contains the core medium
equations. Variables in this model can be accessed just by dot-notation, such
as medium.u or medium.T. If an optional medium variable has to be computed, the
corresponding function from the actual Medium package is called, such as
Medium.dynamicViscosity. The medium.state vector can be given as input argument
to this function, and its fields are kept consistent to those of BaseProperties
by suitable equations, contained in BaseProperties itself (see above).
</p>

<p>If a medium model does not provide implementations of all
optional functions and one of these functions is called in a model, an error
occurs during translation since the optional functions which have not been
redeclared have the <em>partial</em> attribute. For example, if function
dynamicViscosity is not provided in the medium model when it is used, only
simple pressure drop loss models without a reference to the viscosity can be
used and not the sophisticated ones.
</p>

<p>At the bottom of the PartialMedium package type declarations
are present, that are used in all other parts of the PartialMedium package and
that should be used in all models and connectors where a medium model is
accessed. The reason is that minimum, maximum, nominal, and start
values are defined and these values can be adapted to the particular medium at
hand. For example, the nominal value of AbsolutePressure is 10<sup>5</sup>
Pa. If a simple model of water steam is used that is only valid above 100 &deg;C,
then the minimum value in the Temperature type should be set to this value. The
minimum and maximum values are also important for parameters in order to get an
early message if data outside of the validity region is given. The nominal
attribute is important as a scaling value if the variable is used as a state in
a differential equation or as an iteration variable in a non-linear system of
equations. The start attribute can be very useful to provide a meaningful
default start or guess value if the variable is used, e.g., as iteration
variable in a non-linear system of equations. Note, that all these attributes
can be set specifically for a medium in the following way:
</p>

<pre>
<strong>package</strong> MyMedium
  <strong>extends</strong> Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium(
     ...
     Temperature(min=373));
<strong>end</strong> MyMedium;
</pre>

<p>
The type PartialMedium.MassFlowRate is defined as
</p>

<pre>
<strong>type</strong> MassFlowRate = Modelica.SIunits.MassFlowRate
     (quantity = "MassFlowRate." + mediumName);
</pre>

<p>Note that the constant mediumName, that has to be
defined in every medium model, is used in the quantity attribute. For example,
if mediumName = SimpleLiquidWater, then the quantity attribute has the value
MassFlowRate.SimpleLiquidWater. This type should be used in a connector
definition of a fluid library:
</p>

<pre>
<strong>connector</strong> FluidPort
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.MassFlowRate m_flow;
  ...
<strong>end</strong> FluidPort;
</pre>

<p>In the model where this connector is used, the actual
Medium has to be defined. Connectors can only be connected together, if the
corresponding attributes are either not defined or have identical values. Since
mediumName is part of the quantity attribute of MassFlowRate, it is not
possible to connect connectors with different media models together.</p>
