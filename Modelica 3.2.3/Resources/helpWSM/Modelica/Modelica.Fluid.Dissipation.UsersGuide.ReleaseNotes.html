<h4>Version 1.0 Beta 4-6, 2010-01-12</h4>

<p>
Fluid.Dissipation was improved for the release as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Changed structure for input records of all heat transfer and pressure loss
functions:
    <ul>
      <li> Reduced amount of input records for compressible and incompressible functions as well as for their combinational one to improve usability of library.</li>
      <li> Splitting input records of one function into one with parameters (e.g., for geometry) and one with variables (e.g., fluid properties) to ease work of IDE-solver.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Improved Modelica.Fluid application models for available heat transfer and pressure
loss functions:
  <ul>
    <li> Flattened inheritance with one base flow model for all energy devices.</li>
    <li> Implemented smooth state of fluid density and dynamic viscosity for reverse flow.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<li> Adaption of complete library due to structure change.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 1.0 Beta 3, 2009-07-03</h4>

<p>
Fluid.Dissipation was improved for the release as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Changed flow models structure:<br>
Now that a future feature for the automatic choice of using either a mass flow rate (compressible case) or a pressure loss (incompressible case) function for calculation is supported if implemented by IDE. Due to that no manual selection of a compressible or incompressible calculation in the Modelica.Fluid flow models is possible anymore. Therefore nonlinear equations will be created from the Modelica.Fluid flow models, if the future feature is not supported and the mass flow rate is known at a fluid port instead of the pressure loss.
</li>
<li> Changed structure and amount of records used as input for function calls due to
changed structure of flow model.
</li>
<li> Changed structure of function calls due to changed structure of flow model.
</li>
<li> Finished validation of all available heat transfer and pressure loss functions.
</li>
<li> Included scripts for verification of all available heat transfer and pressure loss functions.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 1.0 Beta 2, 2009-04-22</h4>

<p>
Fluid.Dissipation was improved for the release as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Support of analytical Jacobians at inverse calculation of heat transfer and pressure loss functions.
</li>
<li> Included Modelica.Fluid application models for available heat transfer and pressure loss functions.
</li>
<li> Adaption of complete library to Modelica Standard nomenclature.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 1.0 Beta 1, 2008-10-08</h4>

Initial release of Fluid.Dissipation.
