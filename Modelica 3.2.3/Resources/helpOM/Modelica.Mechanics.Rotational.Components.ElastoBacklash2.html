<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This element consists of a <strong>backlash</strong> element
<strong>connected in series</strong> to a <strong>spring</strong>
and <strong>damper</strong> element which are <strong>connected in
parallel</strong>. The spring constant shall be non-zero, otherwise
the component cannot be used.</p>
<p>In combination with components IdealGear, the ElastoBacklash2
model can be used to model a gear box with backlash, elasticity and
damping.</p>
<p>During initialization, the backlash characteristic is replaced
by a continuous approximation in the backlash region, in order to
reduce problems during initialization, especially for inverse
models.</p>
<p>If the backlash b is smaller as 1e-10 rad (especially, if b=0),
then the backlash is ignored and the component reduces to a
spring/damper element in parallel.</p>
<p>In the backlash region (-b/2 ≤ flange_b.phi - flange_a.phi -
phi_rel0 ≤ b/2) no torque is exerted (flange_b.tau = 0). Outside of
this region, contact is present and the contact torque is basically
computed with a linear spring/damper characteristic:</p>
<pre>
   desiredContactTorque = c*phi_contact + d*<strong>der</strong>(phi_contact)

            phi_contact = phi_rel - phi_rel0 - b/2 <strong>if</strong> phi_rel - phi_rel0 &gt;  b/2
                        = phi_rel - phi_rel0 + b/2 <strong>if</strong> phi_rel - phi_rel0 &lt; -b/2

            phi_rel     = flange_b.phi - flange_a.phi;
</pre>
<p>This torque characteristic leads to the following
difficulty:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the damper torque becomes larger as the spring torque and
with opposite sign, the contact torque would be "pulling/sticking"
which is unphysical, since during contact only pushing torques can
occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the literature this issue seems to be not discussed. For this
reason, the most simple approach is used in the ElastoBacklash2
model, by slightly changing the linear spring/damper characteristic
to:</p>
<pre>
    // Torque characteristic when phi_rel &gt; phi_rel0
    <strong>if</strong> phi_rel - phi_rel0 &lt; b/2 <strong>then</strong>
       tau_c = 0;          // spring torque
       tau_d = 0;          // damper torque
       flange_b.tau = 0;
    <strong>else</strong>
       tau_c = c*(phi_rel - phi_rel0);    // spring torque
       tau_d = d*<strong>der</strong>(phi_rel);            // damper torque
       flange_b.tau = <strong>if</strong> tau_c + tau_d ≤ 0 <strong>then</strong> 0 <strong>else</strong> tau_c + tau_d;
    <strong>end if</strong>;
</pre>
<p>Note, when sticking would occur (tau_c + tau_d ≤ 0), then the
contact torque is explicitly set to zero.</p>
<p>This model of backlash is slightly different to the <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Components.ElastoBacklash.html">
ElastoBacklash</a> component:</p>
<ul>
<li>An event occurs when contact occurs or when contact is released
(contrary to the ElastoBacklash component).</li>
<li>When contact occurs, the torque changes discontinuously, due to
the damping. The damping is larger as for the ElastoBacklash
component (for the same damping coefficient), because the
ElastoBacklash component has a heuristic to avoid the discontinuity
of the torque when contact occurs.</li>
<li>For some models, the ElastoBacklash2 component leads to faster
simulations (as compared when using the ElastBacklash
component).</li>
</ul>
