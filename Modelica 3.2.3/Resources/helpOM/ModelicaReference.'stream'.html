<p>Declare stream variable in a connector to describe
bi-directional flow of matter</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<blockquote>
<pre><strong>connector</strong> FluidPort
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
  Medium.AbsolutePressure        p          "Pressure in connection point";
  <strong>flow</strong>   Medium.MassFlowRate     m_flow     "&gt; 0, if flow into component";
  <strong>stream</strong> Medium.SpecificEnthalpy h_outflow  "h close to port if m_flow &lt; 0";
<strong>end</strong> FluidPort;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>FluidPort is a stream connector, because a connector variable
has the stream prefix. The Medium definition and the stream
variables are associated with the only flow variable (m_flow) that
defines a fluid stream. The Medium and the stream variables are
transported with this flow variable. The stream variable h_outflow
is the stream property inside the component close to the boundary,
when fluid flows out of the component into the connection point.
The stream properties for the other flow direction can be inquired
with the built-in operator <a href="ModelicaReference.Operators.%27inStream()%27.html">'inStream()'</a>.
The value of the stream variable corresponding to the actual flow
direction can be inquired through the built-in operator <a href="ModelicaReference.Operators.%27actualStream()%27.html">'actualStream()'</a>.</p>

<pre><strong>model</strong> IsenthalpicFlow "No energy storage/losses, e.g., pressure drop, valve, ..."
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium=Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
  FluidPort port_a, port_b:
  Medium.ThermodynamicState port_a_state_inflow "State at port_a if inflowing";
  Medium.ThermodynamicState port_b_state_inflow "State at port_b if inflowing";
<strong>equation</strong>
  // Medium states for inflowing fluid
  port_a_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_a.p,
                                            <strong>inStream</strong>(port_a.h_outflow));
  port_b_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_b.p,
                                            <strong>inStream</strong>(port_b.h_outflow));
  // Mass balance
  0 = port_a.m_flow + port_b.m_flow;

  // Instantaneous propagation of enthalpy flow between the ports with
  // isenthalpic state transformation (no storage and no loss of energy)
  port_a.h_outflow = <strong>inStream</strong>(port_b.h_outflow);
  port_b.h_outflow = <strong>inStream</strong>(port_a.h_outflow);

  // (Regularized) Momentum balance
  port_a.m_flow = f(port_a.p, port_b.p,
                    Medium.density(port_a_state_inflow),
                    Medium.density(port_b_state_inflow));
<strong>end</strong> IsenthalpicFlow;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>When two or more FluidPort (inside) connectors are connected
together, then <strong>no</strong> connection equations are
generated for <strong>stream</strong> variables. Instead, these
equations are constructed by the <strong>inStream</strong>(..)
built-in operator (see example model IsenthalpicFlow) above. If two
IsenthalpicFlow components are connected together:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>   IsenthalpicFlow dp1;
   IsenthalpicFlow dp2;
<strong>equation</strong>
  <strong>connect</strong>(dp1, dp2);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Then, the following connection equations are generated</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>dp1.p = dp2.p;
0 = dp1.m_flow + dp2.m_flow;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Note, no equation for a stream variable is generated. However,
the inStream(..) operators inside the components provide the "ideal
mixing" equations:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>// within dp1:
  <strong>inStream</strong>(dp1.port_b.h_outflow) := dp2.port_a.h_outflow;

// within dp2:
  <strong>inStream</strong>(dp2.port_a.h_outflow) := dp1.port_b.h_outflow;
</pre></blockquote>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>A detailed description of the stream keyword and the inStream
operator is given in Chapter 15 and Appendix D of the <a href="https://www.modelica.org/documents/ModelicaSpec32Revision1.pdf">Modelica
Language Specification version 3.2 Revision 1</a>. An overview and
a rational is provided in a <a href="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Documentation/Fluid/Stream-Connectors-Overview-Rationale.pdf">
slide set</a>.</p>
<p>The two basic variable types in a connector
<strong>potential</strong> (or across) variable and
<strong>flow</strong> (or through) variable are not sufficient to
describe in a numerically sound way the bi-directional flow of
matter with convective transport of specific quantities, such as
specific enthalpy and chemical composition. The values of these
specific quantities are determined from the upstream side of the
flow, i.e., they depend on the flow direction. When using across
and through variables, the corresponding models would include
nonlinear systems of equations with Boolean unknowns for the flow
directions and singularities around zero flow. Such equation
systems cannot be solved reliably in general. The model
formulations can be simplified when formulating two different
balance equations for the two possible flow directions. This is not
possible with across and through variables though.</p>
<p>This fundamental problem is addressed in Modelica 3.1 by
introducing a third type of connector variable, called stream
variable, declared with the prefix <strong>stream</strong>. A
stream variable describes a quantity that is carried by a flow
variable, i.e., a purely convective transport phenomenon. The value
of the stream variable is the specific property inside the
component close to the boundary, assuming that matter flows out of
the component into the connection point. In other words, it is the
value the carried quantity would have if the fluid was flowing out
of the connector, irrespective of the actual flow direction.</p>
<p>The basic idea is sketched at hand of an example: Three
connectors c1, c2, c3 with the definition</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<strong>connector</strong> Demo
  Real        p;  // potential variable
  <strong>flow</strong>   Real m_flow;  // flow variable
  <strong>stream</strong> Real h;  // stream variable
<strong>end</strong> Demo;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>are connected together with</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<strong>connect</strong>(c1,c2);
<strong>connect</strong>(c1,c3);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>then this leads to the following equations:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
// Potential variables are identical
c1.p = c2.p;
c1.p = c3.p;

// The sum of the flow variables is zero
0 = c1.m_flow + c2.m_flow + c3.m_flow;

/* The sum of the product of flow variables and upstream stream variables is zero
   (this implicit set of equations is explicitly solved when generating code;
   the "&lt;undefined&gt;" parts are defined in such a way that
   inStream(..) is continuous).
*/
0 = c1.m_flow*(<strong>if</strong> c1.m_flow &gt; 0 <strong>then</strong> h_mix <strong>else</strong> c1.h) +
    c2.m_flow*(<strong>if</strong> c2.m_flow &gt; 0 <strong>then</strong> h_mix <strong>else</strong> c2.h) +
    c3.m_flow*(<strong>if</strong> c3.m_flow &gt; 0 <strong>then</strong> h_mix <strong>else</strong> c3.h);

<strong>inStream</strong>(c1.h) = <strong>if</strong> c1.m_flow &gt; 0 <strong>then</strong> h_mix <strong>else</strong> &lt;undefined&gt;;
<strong>inStream</strong>(c2.h) = <strong>if</strong> c2.m_flow &gt; 0 <strong>then</strong> h_mix <strong>else</strong> &lt;undefined&gt;;
<strong>inStream</strong>(c3.h) = <strong>if</strong> c3.m_flow &gt; 0 <strong>then</strong> h_mix <strong>else</strong> &lt;undefined&gt;;

</pre></blockquote>
<p>If at least one variable in a connector has the stream prefix,
the connector is called <strong>stream connector</strong> and the
corresponding variable is called <strong>stream variable</strong>.
The following definitions hold:</p>
<ul>
<li>The stream prefix can only be used in a connector
declaration.</li>
<li>A stream connector must have exactly one scalar variable with
the flow prefix. [<em>The idea is that all stream variables of a
connector are associated with this flow variable</em>].</li>
<li>For every outside connector, one equation is generated for
every variable with the stream prefix [<em>to describe the
propagation of the stream variable along a model hierarchy</em>].
For the exact definition, see the end of section 15.2.</li>
<li>For inside connectors, variables with the stream prefix do not
lead to connection equations.</li>
<li>Connection equations with stream variables are generated in a
model when using the inStream() operator or the actualStream()
operator.</li>
</ul>
<p>For further details, see the definition of the <a href="ModelicaReference.Operators.%27inStream()%27.html">'inStream()'</a>
operator.</p>
