<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This block generates an output signal y[:] by
<strong>constant</strong>, <strong>linear</strong> or <strong>cubic
Hermite spline interpolation</strong> in a table. The time points
and function values are stored in a matrix
<strong>table[i,j]</strong>, where the first column table[:,1]
contains the time points and the other columns contain the data to
be interpolated.</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Blocks/Sources/CombiTimeTable.png" alt="CombiTimeTable.png" /></p>
<p>Via parameter <strong>columns</strong> it can be defined which
columns of the table are interpolated. If, e.g., columns={2,4}, it
is assumed that 2 output signals are present and that the first
output is computed by interpolation of column 2 and the second
output is computed by interpolation of column 4 of the table
matrix. The table interpolation has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The interpolation interval is found by a binary search where
the interval used in the last call is used as start interval.</li>
<li>The time points need to be <strong>strictly increasing</strong>
for cubic Hermite spline interpolation, otherwise
<strong>monotonically increasing</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Discontinuities</strong> are allowed for (constant or)
linear interpolation, by providing the same time point twice in the
table.</li>
<li>Via parameter <strong>smoothness</strong> it is defined how the
data is interpolated:
<pre>
  smoothness = 1: Linear interpolation
             = 2: Akima interpolation: Smooth interpolation by cubic Hermite
                  splines such that der(y) is continuous, also if extrapolated.
             = 3: Constant segments
             = 4: Fritsch-Butland interpolation: Smooth interpolation by cubic
                  Hermite splines such that y preserves the monotonicity and
                  der(y) is continuous, also if extrapolated.
             = 5: Steffen interpolation: Smooth interpolation by cubic Hermite
                  splines such that y preserves the monotonicity and der(y)
                  is continuous, also if extrapolated.
</pre></li>
<li>Values <strong>outside</strong> of the table range, are
computed by extrapolation according to the setting of parameter
<strong>extrapolation</strong>:
<pre>
  extrapolation = 1: Hold the first or last value of the table,
                     if outside of the table scope.
                = 2: Extrapolate by using the derivative at the first/last table
                     points if outside of the table scope.
                     (If smoothness is LinearSegments or ConstantSegments
                     this means to extrapolate linearly through the first/last
                     two table points.).
                = 3: Periodically repeat the table data (periodical function).
                = 4: No extrapolation, i.e. extrapolation triggers an error
</pre></li>
<li>If the table has only <strong>one row</strong>, no
interpolation is performed and the table values of this row are
just returned.</li>
<li>Via parameters <strong>shiftTime</strong> and
<strong>offset</strong> the curve defined by the table can be
shifted both in time and in the ordinate value. The time instants
stored in the table are therefore <strong>relative</strong> to
<strong>shiftTime</strong>.</li>
<li>If time &lt; startTime, no interpolation is performed and the
offset is used as ordinate value for all outputs.</li>
<li>The table is implemented in a numerically sound way by
generating <strong>time events</strong> at interval boundaries, in
case of interpolation by linear segments. This generates
continuously differentiable values for the integrator. Via
parameter <strong>timeEvents</strong> it is defined how the time
events are generated:
<pre>
  timeEvents = 1: Always generate time events at interval boundaries
             = 2: Generate time events at discontinuities (defined by duplicated sample points)
             = 3: No time events at interval boundaries
</pre>
For interpolation by constant segments time events are always
generated at interval boundaries. For smooth interpolation by cubic
Hermite splines no time events are generated at interval
boundaries.</li>
<li>Via parameter <strong>timeScale</strong> the first column of
the table array can be scaled, e.g., if the table array is given in
hours (instead of seconds) <strong>timeScale</strong> shall be set
to 3600.</li>
<li>For special applications it is sometimes needed to know the
minimum and maximum time instant defined in the table as a
parameter. For this reason parameters
<strong>t_min</strong>/<strong>t_minScaled</strong> and
<strong>t_max</strong>/<strong>t_maxScaled</strong> are provided
and can be accessed from the outside of the table object. Whereas
<strong>t_min</strong> and <strong>t_max</strong> define the scaled
abscissa values (using parameter <strong>timeScale</strong>) in
SIunits.Time, <strong>t_minScaled</strong> and
<strong>t_maxScaled</strong> define the unitless original abscissa
values of the table.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
   table = [0, 0;
            1, 0;
            1, 1;
            2, 4;
            3, 9;
            4, 16];
   extrapolation = 2 (default), timeEvents = 2
If, e.g., time = 1.0, the output y =  0.0 (before event), 1.0 (after event)
    e.g., time = 1.5, the output y =  2.5,
    e.g., time = 2.0, the output y =  4.0,
    e.g., time = 5.0, the output y = 23.0 (i.e., extrapolation via last 2 points).
</pre>
<p>The table matrix can be defined in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explicitly supplied as <strong>parameter matrix</strong>
"table", and the other parameters have the following values:
<pre>
   tableName is "NoName" or has only blanks,
   fileName  is "NoName" or has only blanks.
</pre></li>
<li><strong>Read</strong> from a <strong>file</strong> "fileName"
where the matrix is stored as "tableName". Both text and MATLAB
MAT-file format is possible. (The text format is described below).
The MAT-file format comes in four different versions: v4, v6, v7
and v7.3. The library supports at least v4, v6 and v7 whereas v7.3
is optional. It is most convenient to generate the MAT-file from
FreeMat or MATLAB® by command
<pre>
   save tables.mat tab1 tab2 tab3
</pre>
or Scilab by command
<pre>
   savematfile tables.mat tab1 tab2 tab3
</pre>
when the three tables tab1, tab2, tab3 should be used from the
model.<br />
Note, a fileName can be defined as URI by using the helper function
<a href="Modelica.Utilities.Files.loadResource.html">loadResource</a>.</li>
<li>Statically stored in function "usertab" in file "usertab.c".
The matrix is identified by "tableName". Parameter fileName =
"NoName" or has only blanks. Row-wise storage is always to be
preferred as otherwise the table is reallocated and
transposed.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the constant "NO_FILE_SYSTEM" is defined, all file I/O
related parts of the source code are removed by the C-preprocessor,
such that no access to files takes place.</p>
<p>If tables are read from a text file, the file needs to have the
following structure ("-----" is not part of the file content):</p>
<pre>
-----------------------------------------------------
#1
double tab1(6,2)   # comment line
  0   0
  1   0
  1   1
  2   4
  3   9
  4  16
double tab2(6,2)   # another comment line
  0   0
  2   0
  2   2
  4   8
  6  18
  8  32
-----------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>Note, that the first two characters in the file need to be "#1"
(a line comment defining the version number of the file format).
Afterwards, the corresponding matrix has to be declared with type
(= "double" or "float"), name and actual dimensions. Finally, in
successive rows of the file, the elements of the matrix have to be
given. The elements have to be provided as a sequence of numbers in
row-wise order (therefore a matrix row can span several lines in
the file and need not start at the beginning of a line). Numbers
have to be given according to C syntax (such as 2.3, -2, +2.e4).
Number separators are spaces, tab (\t), comma (,), or semicolon
(;). Several matrices may be defined one after another. Line
comments start with the hash symbol (#) and can appear everywhere.
Text files should either be ASCII or UTF-8 encoded, where UTF-8
encoded strings are only allowed in line comments and an optional
UTF-8 BOM at the start of the text file is ignored. Other
characters, like trailing non comments, are not allowed in the
file.</p>
