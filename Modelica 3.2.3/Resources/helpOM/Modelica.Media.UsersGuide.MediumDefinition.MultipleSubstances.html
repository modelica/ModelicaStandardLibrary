<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>When writing the model of a multiple-substance medium, a
fundamental issue concerns how to consider the mass fractions of
the fluid. If there are nS substances, there are also nS mass
fractions; however, one of them is redundant, as sum(X) = 1.
Therefore there are basically two options, concerning the number of
independent mass fractions nXi:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Reduced-state models</em>: reducedX = <strong>true</strong>
and nXi = nS - 1. In this case, the number of independent mass
fractions nXi is the minimum possible. The full state vector X is
provided by equations declared in the base class
Interfaces.PartialMedium.BaseProperties: the first nXi elements are
equal to Xi, and the last one is 1 - sum(Xi).</li>
<li><em>Full-state models</em>: reducedX = <strong>false</strong>
and nXi = nS. In this case, Xi = X, i.e., all the elements of the
composition vector are considered as independent variables, and the
constraint sum(X) = 1 is never written explicitly. Although this
kind of model is heavier, as it provides one extra state variable,
it can be less prone to numerical and/or symbolic problems, which
can be caused by that constraint.</li>
<li><em>Fixed-composition models</em>: fixedX =
<strong>true</strong> and nXi = 0. In this case X = reference_X,
i.e., all the elements of the composition vector are fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The medium implementer can declare the value reducedX as
<strong>final</strong>. In this way only one implementation must be
given. For instance, Modelica.Media.IdealGases models declare
<strong>final</strong> reducedX = <strong>false</strong>, so that
the implementation can always assume nXi = nX. The same is true for
Air.MoistAir, which declares <strong>final</strong> reducedX =
<strong>true</strong>, and always assumes nXi = nX - 1 = 1.</p>
<p>It is also possible to leave reducedX modifiable. In this case,
the BaseProperties model and all additional functions should check
for the actual value of reducedX, and provide the corresponding
implementation.</p>
<p>If fixedX is left modifiable, then the implementation should
also handle the case fixedX = true properly.</p>
<p>Fluid connectors should always use composition vectors of size
Xi, such as in the Modelica_Fluid library:</p>
<pre>
<strong>connector</strong> FluidPort
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
  Medium.AbsolutePressure      p;
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.MassFlowRate     m_flow;

  Medium.SpecificEnthalpy      h;
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.EnthalpyFlowRate H_flow;

  Medium.MassFraction          Xi    [Medium.nXi];
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.MassFlowRate     mX_flow[Medium.nXi];
<strong>end</strong> FluidPort;
</pre>

model</a> and <a href="Modelica.Media.Air.MoistAir.html">MoistAir model</a>.</p>
