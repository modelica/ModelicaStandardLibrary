<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>In this section some hints are given to define your own
1-dimensional translational components which are compatible with
the elements of this package. It is convenient to define a new
component by inheritance from one of the following base classes,
which are defined in sublibrary Interfaces:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Interfaces.PartialCompliant.html">
PartialCompliant</a></td>
<td>Compliant connection of two translational 1-dim. flanges (used
for force laws such as a spring or a damper).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Interfaces.PartialCompliantWithRelativeStates.html">
PartialCompliantWithRelativeStates</a></td>
<td>Same as "PartialCompliant", but relative position and relative
speed are defined as preferred states. Use this partial model if
the force law needs anyway the relative speed. The advantage is
that it is usually better to use relative positions between drive
train components as states, especially, if the position is not
limited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Interfaces.PartialElementaryTwoFlangesAndSupport2.html">
PartialElementaryTwoFlangesAndSupport2</a></td>
<td>Partial model for a 1-dim. translational component consisting
of the flange of an input shaft, the flange of an output shaft and
the support.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Interfaces.PartialForce.html">
PartialForce</a></td>
<td>Partial model of a force acting at the flange (accelerates the
flange).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Interfaces.PartialTwoFlanges.html">
PartialTwoFlanges</a></td>
<td>General connection of two translational 1-dim. flanges.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Interfaces.PartialAbsoluteSensor.html">
PartialAbsoluteSensor</a></td>
<td>Measure absolute flange variables.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Interfaces.PartialRelativeSensor.html">
PartialRelativeSensor</a></td>
<td>Measure relative flange variables.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The difference between these base classes are the auxiliary
variables defined in the model and the relations between the flange
variables already defined in the base class. For example, in model
<strong>PartialCompliant</strong> there is no support flange,
whereas in model
<strong>PartialElementaryTwoFlangesAndSupport2</strong> there is a
support flange.</p>
<p>The equations of a mechanical component are vector equations,
i.e., they need to be expressed in a common coordinate system.
Therefore, for a component a <strong>local axis of
movement</strong> has to be defined. All vector quantities, such as
cut-forces or velocities have to be expressed according to this
definition. Examples for such a definition are given in the
following figure for a mass component:</p>
<p><img alt="driveAxis" src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Mechanics/Translational/driveAxis.png"/></p>
<p>As can be seen, all vectors are directed into the direction of
the movement axis. The positions in the flanges are defined
correspondingly.</p>
<p>On first view, one may assume that the selected local coordinate
system has an influence on the usage of the component. But this is
not the case, as shown in the next figure:</p>
<p><img alt="masses" src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Mechanics/Translational/masses.png"/></p>
<p>In the figure the <strong>local</strong> axes of rotation of the
components are shown. The connection of two masses in the left and
in the right part of the figure are completely equivalent, i.e.,
the right part is just a different drawing of the left part. This
is due to the fact, that by a connection, the two local coordinate
systems are made identical and the (automatically) generated
connection equations (= positions are identical, cut-forces sum-up
to zero) are also expressed in this common coordinate system.
Therefore, even if in the left figure it seems to be that the
velocity vector of <code>m2</code> goes from right to left, in
reality it goes from left to right as shown in the right part of
the figure, where the local coordinate systems are drawn such that
they are aligned. Note, that the simple rule stated in section 4
(Sign conventions) also determines that the velocity of
<code>m2</code> in the left part of the figure is directed from
left to right.</p>
<p>To summarize, the local coordinate system selected for a
component is just necessary, in order that the equations of this
component are expressed correctly. The selection of the coordinate
system is arbitrary and has no influence on the usage of the
component. Especially, the actual direction of, e.g., a cut-force
is most easily determined by the rule of section 4. A more strict
determination by aligning coordinate systems and then using the
vector direction of the local coordinate systems, often requires a
re-drawing of the diagram and is therefore less convenient to
use.</p>
