<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p><strong>Rigid body</strong> where the inertia tensor is
neglected. This body is solely defined by its mass. By default,
this component is visualized by a <strong>sphere</strong> that has
its center at frame_a. Note, that the animation may be switched off
via parameter animation = <strong>false</strong>.</p>
<p>Every PointMass has potential states. If possible a tool will
select the states of joints and not the states of PointMass because
this is usually the most efficient choice. In this case the
position and velocity of frame_a of the body will be computed by
the component that is connected to frame_a. However, if a PointMass
is moving freely in space, variables of the PointMass have to be
used as states. The potential states are: The <strong>position
vector</strong> frame_a.r_0 from the origin of the world frame to
the origin of frame_a of the body, resolved in the world frame and
the <strong>absolute velocity</strong> v_0 of the origin of
frame_a, resolved in the world frame (= der(frame_a.r_0)).</p>
<p>Whether or not variables of the body are used as states is
usually automatically selected by the Modelica translator. If
parameter <strong>enforceStates</strong> is set to
<strong>true</strong> in the "Advanced" menu, then PointMass
variables frame_a.r_0 and der(frame_a.r_0) are forced to be used as
states.</p>
