<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Model <strong>FixedShape2</strong> defines a visual shape that
is shown at the location of its frame_a. This model is identical to
<strong>FixedShape</strong> with the only difference that an
additional frame_b is present which is parallel to frame_a. This
makes it more convenient to connect several visual shapes together
when building up more complex visual objects. All describing data
such as size and color can vary dynamically by providing
appropriate expressions in the input fields of the parameter menu.
The only exception is parameter shapeType that cannot be changed
during simulation. The following shapes are currently supported via
parameter <strong>shapeType</strong> (e.g., shapeType="box"):<br/>
 </p>

<p> <br/>
The dark blue arrows in the figure above are directed along
variable <strong>lengthDirection</strong>. The light blue arrows
are directed along variable <strong>widthDirection</strong>. The
<strong>coordinate systems</strong> in the figure represent frame_a
of the FixedShape component.</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>external shapes</strong> can be specified
as (not all options might be supported by all tools):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"1", "2", ...</strong><br/>
define external shapes specified in DXF format in files "1.dxf",
"2.dxf", ... The DXF-files must be found either in the current
directory or in the directory where the Shape instance is stored
that references the DXF file. This (very limited) option should not
be used for new models. Example:<br/>
shapeType="1".<br/></li>
<li>
"<strong>modelica:</strong>//&lt;Modelica-name&gt;/&lt;relative-path-file-name&gt;"<br/>

characterizes the file that is stored under the location of the
&lt;Modelica-name&gt; library path with the given relative file
name. Example:<br/>
shapeType =
"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Data/Shapes/Engine/piston.dxf".<br/>
</li>
<li>"<strong>file:</strong>//&lt;absolute-file-name&gt;"<br/>
characterizes an absolute file name in the file system.
Example:<br/>
shapeType="file://C:/users/myname/shapes/piston.dxf".</li>
</ul>
<p>The supported file formats are tool dependent. Most tools
support at least DXF-files but may support other format as well
(such as stl, obj, 3ds). Since visualization files contain color
and other data, the corresponding information in the model is
usually ignored. For information about DXF files, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD_DXF">Wikipedia</a>. As a
default it is assumed that the DXF coordinates are in the
"frame_a"-system and in meters, and that the 3dfaces are two-sided.
Some tools support only 3dface (for geometry) and layer (for
advanced coloring).</p>
<p>The sizes of any of the above components are specified by the
<strong>length</strong>, <strong>width</strong> and
<strong>height</strong> variables. Via variable
<strong>extra</strong> additional data can be defined:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<th><strong>shapeType</strong></th>
<th>Meaning of parameter <strong>extra</strong></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"cylinder"</td>
<td>if extra &gt; 0, a black line is included in the
cylinder to show the rotation of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"cone"</td>
<td>extra = diameter-left-side / diameter-right-side, i.e.,<br/>
extra = 1: cylinder<br/>
extra = 0: "real" cone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"pipe"</td>
<td>extra = outer-diameter / inner-diameter, i.e,<br/>
extra = 1: cylinder that is completely hollow<br/>
extra = 0: cylinder without a hole.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"gearwheel"</td>
<td>extra is the number of teeth of the (external) gear. If
extra &lt; 0, an internal gear is visualized with |extra|
teeth. The axis of the gearwheel is along "lengthDirection", and
usually: width = height = 2*radiusOfGearWheel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"spring"</td>
<td>extra is the number of windings of the spring. Additionally,
"height" is <strong>not</strong> the "height" but
2*coil-width.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>external shape</td>
<td>extra = 0: Visualization from file is not scaled.<br/>
extra = 1: Visualization from file is scaled with "length", "width"
and "height" of the shape</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Parameter <strong>color</strong> is a vector with 3 elements,
{r, g, b}, and specifies the color of the shape.
{r, g, b} are the "red", "green" and "blue" color parts.
Note, r, g, b are given as Integer[3] in the ranges
0 .. 255, respectively. The predefined type <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Types.Color.html">MultiBody.Types.Color</a>
contains a menu definition of the colors used in the MultiBody
library together with a color editor.</p>
<p>In the following figure the relationships between frame_a and
frame_b are shown. The origin of frame_b with respect to frame_a is
specified via parameter vector <strong>r</strong>.</p>
