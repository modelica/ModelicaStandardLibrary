<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Let's now walk through the definition of a new medium model.
Please refer to <a href="Modelica.Media.Interfaces.TemplateMedium.html">Modelica.Media.Interfaces.TemplateMedium</a>
to obtain a template of the new medium model code. For the moment
being, consider a single-substance medium model.</p>
<p>The new medium model is obtained by extending
Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium, and setting the following
package constants:</p>
<ul>
<li>mediumName is a String containing the name of the medium.</li>
<li>substanceNames is a vector of strings containing the names of
the substances that make up the medium. In this case, it will
contain only mediumName.</li>
<li>singleState can be set to true if u and d in BaseProperties do
not depend on pressure. In other words, density does not depend on
pressure (incompressible fluid), and it is assumed that also u does
not depend on pressure. This setting can be useful for fluids
having high density and low compressibility (e.g., liquids at
moderate pressure); fast states resulting from the low
compressibility effects are automatically avoided.</li>
<li>reducedX = true for single-substance media, which do not need
mass fractions at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also possible to change the default min, max, nominal, and
start attributes of Medium-defined types (see TemplateMedium).</p>
<p>All other package constants, such as nX, nXi, nS, are
automatically set by the declarations of the base package
Interfaces.PartialMedium.</p>
<p>The second step is to provide an implementation to the
BaseProperties model, partially defined in the base class
Interfaces.PartialMedium. In the case of single-substance media,
two independent state variables must be selected among p, T, d, u,
h, and three equations must be written to provide the values of the
remaining variables. Two equations must then be added to compute
the molar mass MM and the gas constant R.</p>
<p>The third step is to consider the optional functions that are
going to be implemented, among the partial functions defined by the
base class PartialMedium. A minimal set of state variables that
could be provided as an input to <em>all</em> those functions must
be selected, and included in the redeclaration of the
ThermodynamicState record. Subsequently, equations must be added to
BaseProperties in order that the instance of that record inside
BaseProperties (named "state") is kept updated. For example, assume
that all additional properties can be computed as a function of p
and T. Then, ThermodynamicState should be redeclared as
follows:</p>
<pre>
  <strong>redeclare replaceable record</strong> ThermodynamicState
    AbsolutePressure p "Absolute pressure of medium";
    Temperature T "Temperature of medium";
  <strong>end</strong> ThermodynamicState;
</pre>
<p>and the following equations should be added to
BaseProperties:</p>
<pre>
  state.p = p;
  state.T = T;
</pre>
<p>The additional functions can now be implemented by redeclaring
the functions defined in the base class and adding their
algorithms, e.g.:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>redeclare function extends</strong> dynamicViscosity "Return dynamic viscosity"
    <strong>algorithm</strong>
      eta := 10 - state.T*0.3 + state.p*0.2;
    <strong>end</strong> dynamicViscosity;
</pre>
