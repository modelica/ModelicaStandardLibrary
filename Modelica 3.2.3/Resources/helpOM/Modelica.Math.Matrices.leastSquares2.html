<h4>Syntax</h4>
<blockquote>
<pre>
X = Matrices.<strong>leastSquares2</strong>(A,B);
</pre></blockquote>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Returns a solution of equation A*X = B in a least square sense
(A may be rank deficient):</p>
<pre>
  minimize | A*X - B |
</pre>
<p>Several different cases can be distinguished (note,
<strong>rank</strong> is an output argument of this function):</p>
<p><strong>size(A,1) = size(A,2)</strong></p>
<p>A solution is returned for a regular, as well as a singular
matrix A:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>rank</strong> = size(A,1):<br/>
A is <strong>regular</strong> and the returned solution X fulfills
the equation A*X = B uniquely.</li>
<li><strong>rank</strong> &lt; size(A,1):<br/>
A is <strong>singular</strong> and no unique solution for equation
A*X = B exists.
<ul>
<li>If an infinite number of solutions exists, the one is selected
that fulfills the equation and at the same time has the minimum
norm |x| for all solution vectors that fulfill the equation.</li>
<li>If no solution exists, X is selected such that |A*X - B| is as
small as possible (but A*X - B is not zero).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>size(A,1) &gt; size(A,2):</strong></p>
<p>The equation A*X = B has no unique solution. The solution X is
selected such that |A*X - B| is as small as possible. If rank =
size(A,2), this minimum norm solution is unique. If rank &lt;
size(A,2), there are an infinite number of solutions leading to the
same minimum value of |A*X - B|. From these infinite number of
solutions, the one with the minimum norm |X| is selected. This
gives a unique solution that minimizes both |A*X - B| and |X|.</p>
<p><strong>size(A,1) &lt; size(A,2):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>rank</strong> = size(A,1):<br/>
There are an infinite number of solutions that fulfill the equation
A*X = B. From this infinite number, the unique solution is selected
that minimizes |X|.</li>
<li><strong>rank</strong> &lt; size(A,1):<br/>
There is either no solution of equation A*X = B, or there are again
an infinite number of solutions. The unique solution X is returned
that minimizes both |A*X - B| and |X|.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, the solution is computed with the LAPACK function
"dgelsy", i.e., QR or LQ factorization of A with column
pivoting.</p>
<h4>Algorithmic details</h4>
<p>The function first computes a QR factorization with column
pivoting:</p>
<pre>
      A * P = Q * [ R11 R12 ]
                  [  0  R22 ]
</pre>
<p>with R11 defined as the largest leading submatrix whose
estimated condition number is less than 1/rcond. The order of R11,
<strong>rank</strong>, is the effective rank of A.</p>
<p>Then, R22 is considered to be negligible, and R12 is annihilated
by orthogonal transformations from the right, arriving at the
complete orthogonal factorization:</p>
<pre>
     A * P = Q * [ T11 0 ] * Z
                 [  0  0 ]
</pre>
<p>The minimum-norm solution is then</p>
<pre>
     X = P * Z' [ inv(T11)*Q1'*B ]
                [        0       ]
</pre>
<p>where Q1 consists of the first "rank" columns of Q.</p>
