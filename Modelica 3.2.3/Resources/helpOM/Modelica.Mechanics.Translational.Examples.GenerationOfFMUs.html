<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This example demonstrates how to generate an input/output block
(e.g. in form of an FMU - <a href="https://www.fmi-standard.org">Functional Mock-up Unit</a>) from
various Translational components. The goal is to export such an
input/output block from Modelica and import it in another modeling
environment. The essential issue is that before exporting it must
be known in which way the component is utilized in the target
environment. Depending on the target usage, different flange
variables need to be in the interface with either input or output
causality. Note, this example model can be used to test the FMU
export/import of a Modelica tool. Just export the components marked
in the icons as "toFMU" as FMUs and import them back. The models
should then still work and give the same results as a pure Modelica
model.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting two masses</strong><br/>
The upper part (DirectMass, InverseMass) demonstrates how to export
two masses and connect them together in a target system. This
requires that one of the masses (here: DirectMass) is defined to
have states and the position, velocity and acceleration are
provided in the interface. The other mass (here: InverseMass) is
moved according to the provided input position, velocity and
acceleration.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting a force element that needs position and
velocities</strong><br/>
The middle part (SpringDamper) demonstrates how to export a force
element that needs both position and velocities for its force law
and connect this force law in a target system between two
masses.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting a force element that needs only
positions</strong><br/>
The lower part (Spring) demonstrates how to export a force element
that needs only positions for its force law and connect this force
law in a target system between two masses.</p>
