<h4>Development branches</h4>
<p>Further development and maintenance of the Modelica Standard
Library is performed with two branches on the public <a href="https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaStandardLibrary.git">GitHub
repository</a> of the Modelica Association.</p>
<h5>Main development branch</h5>
<p>Name: "master"</p>
<p>This branch contains the actual development version, i.e., all
bug fixes and new features. New features must have been tested
before including them. However, the exhaustive tests for a new
version are (usually) not performed. This version is usually only
be used by the developers of the Modelica Standard Library and is
not utilized by Modelica users.</p>
<h5>Maintenance branch</h5>
<p>Name: "maint/3.2.3"</p>
<p>This branch contains the released Modelica Standard Library
version (e.g., v3.2.3) where all bug fixes since this release date
are included (up to a new release, when becoming available; i.e.,
after a new release, the previous maintenance versions are no
longer changed). These bug fixes might be not yet tested with all
test cases or with other Modelica libraries. The goal is that a
vendor may take this version at any time for a new release of its
software, in order to incorporate the latest bug fixes, without
changing the version number of the Modelica Standard Library.</p>
<h4>Contribution workflow</h4>
<p>The general <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/">contribution
workflow</a> is usually as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fork the repository to your account by <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">using the Fork
button</a> of the GitHub repository site.</li>
<li>Clone the forked repository to your computer. Make sure to
checkout the maintenance branch if the bug fix is going to get
merged to the maintenance branch.</li>
<li>Create a new topic branch and give it a meaningful name, like,
e.g., "issue2161-fix-formula".</li>
<li>Do your code changes and commit them, one change per commit.
Single commits can be copied to other branches. Multiple commits
can be squashed into one, but splitting is difficult.</li>
<li>Once you are done, push your topic branch to your forked
repository.</li>
<li>Go to the upstream <a href="https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaStandardLibrary.git">https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaStandardLibrary.git</a>
repository and submit a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">Pull
Request</a> (PR). If the PR is related to a certain issue,
reference it by its number like this: #2161. Once a pull request is
opened, you can discuss and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/">review</a>
the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits
before the changes are merged into the repository.</li>
<li>Update your branch with the requested changes. If necessary,
merge the latest "master" branch into your topic branch and solve
all merge conflicts in your topic branch.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are some special guidelines for changes to the maintenance
branch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every change to the maintenance branch has to get cherry-picked
at the "master" branch (see above), too. One exception are pure
changes to the "versionBuild" annotation as these have no meaning
in the development trunk.</li>
<li>Annotations "version" and "versionDate" must <u>not</u> be
changed in a maintenance release.</li>
<li>Since the version number can currently not be changed when
releasing a new maintenance release (also known as bug fix release)
the Modelica Standard Library utilizes the "versionBuild"
annotation for this purpose. So should there be a new maintenance
release in the maintenance branch then the "versionBuild" number
needs to be incremented by one. At the same time the "dateModified"
field needs to be updated.<br/>
Example:
<pre>  annotation(version      = "3.2.3",
             versionDate  = "2019-01-23",
             versionBuild = 2,
             dateModified = "2019-01-23 07:40:19Z",
             revisionId   = "$F​ormat:%h %ci$")</pre>
The "revisionId" field is a special annotation to mark a properly
released (maintenance) version from unreleased commits.<br/>
Example:
<blockquote>Running the export command "<code>git archive -o
msl.zip v3.2.3</code>" will expand the above "revisionId" place
holder to something like:
<pre>revisionId = "c04e23a0d 2019-01-23 12:00:00 +0200$"</pre></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a recommendation, a valid bug fix to the maintenance branch
may contain one or more of the following changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Correcting an equation.</li>
<li>Correcting attributes quantity/unit/defaultUnit in a
declaration.</li>
<li>Improving/fixing the documentation.</li>
<li>Introducing a new name in the public section of a class (model,
package, ...) or in any section of a partial class is
<strong>not</strong> allowed. Since otherwise, a user might use
this new name and when storing its model and loading it with an
older build-version, an error would occur.</li>
<li>Introducing a new name in the protected section of a
non-partial class should only be done if absolutely necessary to
fix a bug. The problem is that this might be non-backward
compatible, because a user might already extend from this class and
already using the same name.</li>
</ul>
