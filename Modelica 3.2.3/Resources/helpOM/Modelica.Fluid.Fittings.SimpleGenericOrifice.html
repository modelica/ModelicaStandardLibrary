<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This pressure drop component defines a simple, generic orifice,
where the loss factor ζ is provided for one flow direction (e.g.,
from loss table of a book):</p>
<pre>   Δp = 0.5*ζ*ρ*v*|v|
      = 8*ζ/(π^2*D^4*ρ) * m_flow*|m_flow|
</pre>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li>Δp is the pressure drop: Δp = port_a.p - port_b.p</li>
<li>D is the diameter of the orifice at the position where ζ is
defined (either at port_a or port_b). If the orifice has not a
circular cross section, D = 4*A/P, where A is the cross section
area and P is the wetted perimeter.</li>
<li>ζ is the loss factor with respect to D that depends on the
geometry of the orifice. In the turbulent flow regime, it is
assumed that ζ is constant.<br />
For small mass flow rates, the flow is laminar and is approximated
by a polynomial that has a finite derivative for m_flow=0.</li>
<li>v is the mean velocity.</li>
<li>ρ is the upstream density.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the pressure loss factor zeta is provided only for a mass
flow from port_a to port_b, the pressure loss is not correct when
the flow is reversing. If reversing flow only occurs in a short
time interval, this is most likely uncritical. If significant
reversing flow can appear, this component should not be used.</p>
