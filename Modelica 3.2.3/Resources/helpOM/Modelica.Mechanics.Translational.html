<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This package contains components to model <em>1-dimensional
translational mechanical</em> systems.</p>
<p>The <em>filled</em> and <em>non-filled green squares</em> at the
left and right side of a component represent <em>mechanical
flanges</em>. Drawing a line between such squares means that the
corresponding flanges are <em>rigidly attached</em> to each other.
The components of this library can be usually connected together in
an arbitrary way. E.g. it is possible to connect two springs or two
sliding masses with inertia directly together.</p>
<p>The only <em>connection restriction</em> is that the Coulomb
friction elements (e.g., MassWithStopAndFriction) should be only
connected together provided a compliant element, such as a spring,
is in between. The reason is that otherwise the frictional force is
not uniquely defined if the elements are stuck at the same time
instant (i.e., there does not exist a unique solution) and some
simulation systems may not be able to handle this situation, since
this leads to a singularity during simulation. It can only be
resolved in a "clean way" by combining the two connected friction
elements into one component and resolving the ambiguity of the
frictional force in the stuck mode.</p>
<p>Another restriction arises if the hard stops in model
MassWithStopAndFriction are used, i. e. the movement of the mass is
limited by a stop at smax or smin. <font color="#FF0000"><strong>This requires the states Stop.s and
Stop.v</strong></font> . If these states are eliminated during the
index reduction the model will not work. To avoid this any inertias
should be connected via springs to the Stop element, other sliding
masses, dampers or hydraulic chambers must be avoided.</p>
<p>In the <em>icon</em> of every component an <em>arrow</em> is
displayed in grey color. This arrow characterizes the coordinate
system in which the vectors of the component are resolved. It is
directed into the positive translational direction (in the
mathematical sense). In the flanges of a component, a coordinate
system is rigidly attached to the flange. It is called <em>flange
frame</em> and is directed in parallel to the component coordinate
system. As a result, e.g., the positive cut-force of a "left"
flange (flange_a) is directed into the flange, whereas the positive
cut-force of a "right" flange (flange_b) is directed out of the
flange. A flange is described by a Modelica connector containing
the following variables:</p>
<pre>
   Modelica.SIunits.Position s    "Absolute position of flange";
   <strong>flow</strong> Modelica.SIunits.Force f  "Cut-force in the flange";
</pre>
<p>This library is designed in a fully object oriented way in order
that components can be connected together in every meaningful
combination (e.g., direct connection of two springs or two shafts
with inertia). As a consequence, most models lead to a system of
differential-algebraic equations of <em>index 3</em> (= constraint
equations have to be differentiated twice in order to arrive at a
state space representation) and the Modelica translator or the
simulator has to cope with this system representation. According to
our present knowledge, this requires that the Modelica translator
is able to symbolically differentiate equations (otherwise it is
e.g., not possible to provide consistent initial conditions; even
if consistent initial conditions are present, most numerical DAE
integrators can cope at most with index 2 DAEs).</p>
<p>In version 3.2 of the Modelica Standard Library, all
<strong>dissipative</strong> components of the Translational
library got an optional <strong>heatPort</strong> connector to
which the dissipated energy is transported in form of heat. This
connector is enabled via parameter "useHeatPort". If the heatPort
connector is enabled, it must be connected, and if it is not
enabled, it must not be connected. Independently, whether the
heatPort is enabled or not, the dissipated power is available from
the new variable "<strong>lossPower</strong>" (which is positive if
heat is flowing out of the heatPort). For an example, see <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Examples.HeatLosses.html">Examples.HeatLosses</a>.</p>
