<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This is a connector for 1-dim. translational mechanical systems
which represents a mechanical flange. In the cut plane of the
flange a unit vector n, called flange axis, is defined which is
directed INTO the cut plane, i. e. from left to right. All vectors
in the cut plane are resolved with respect to this unit vector.
E.g. force f characterizes a vector which is directed in the
direction of n with value equal to f. When this flange is connected
to other 1D translational flanges, this means that the axes vectors
of the connected flanges are identical.</p>
<p>The following variables are transported through this
connector:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
s: Absolute position of the flange in [m]. A positive translation
   means that the flange is translated along the flange axis.
f: Cut-force in direction of the flange axis in [N].
</pre></blockquote>
