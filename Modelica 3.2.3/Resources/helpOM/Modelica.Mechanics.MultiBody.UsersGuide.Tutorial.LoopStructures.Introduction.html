<p>In principal, no special action is needed, if loop structures
occur (contrary to the ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody library). An
example is presented in the figure below. It is available as
<a href="Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Examples.Loops.Fourbar1.html">MultiBody.Examples.Loops.Fourbar1</a></p>

<p>This mechanism consists of&nbsp;6 revolute joints and&nbsp;1
prismatic joint and forms a kinematical loop. It has one degree of
freedom. In the next figure the default animation is shown. Note,
that the axes of the revolute joints are represented by the red
cylinders and that the axis of the prismatic joint is represented
by the red box on the lower right side.</p>

<p>Whenever loop structures occur, non-linear algebraic equations
are present on "position level". It is then usually not possible by
structural analysis to select states during translation (which is
possible for non-loop structures). In the example above, a
non-linear algebraic loop of 54 equations can be detected and
reduced to a system of&nbsp;6 coupled algebraic equations. Note,
that this is performed without using any "cut-joints" as it is
usually done in multi-body programs, but by just appropriate
symbolic equation manipulation. Via the dynamic dummy derivative
method the generalized coordinates on position and velocity level
from one of the&nbsp;7 joints are dynamically selected as states
during simulation. Whenever, these two states are no longer
appropriate, states from one of the other joints are selected
during simulation.</p>
<p>The efficiency of loop structures can usually be enhanced, if
states are statically fixed at translation time. For this
mechanism, the generalized coordinates of joint j1 (i.e., the
rotation angle of the revolute joint and its derivative; the joint
is visualized as a red cylinder at the x-axis in the animation
figure above) can always be used as states. In the abovementioned
example, this is already stated by setting parameter
"stateSelect&nbsp;=&nbsp;<strong>StateSelect.always</strong>" in
the "Advanced" menu of that joint. When setting this flag for joint
j1 in that way in the four bar mechanism, a non-linear algebraic
loop of 40 equations can be detected and reduced to a system
of&nbsp;5 coupled non-linear algebraic equations.</p>
<p>In many mechanisms it is possible to solve the non-linear
algebraic equations analytically. For a certain class of systems
this can be performed also with the MultiBody library. This
technique is described in section "<a href="Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.UsersGuide.Tutorial.LoopStructures.AnalyticLoopHandling.html">Analytic
loop handling</a>".</p>
