<p>This component consists of <strong>2 revolute</strong> joints
with parallel axes of rotation that and a
<strong>prismatic</strong> joint with a translational axis that is
orthogonal to the revolute joint axes, see the default animation in
the following figure (the axes vectors are not part of the default
animation):</p>

<p>This joint aggregation introduces neither constraints nor state
variables and should therefore be used in kinematic loops whenever
possible to avoid non-linear systems of equations. It is only
meaningful to use this component in <strong>planar loops</strong>.
Basically, the position and orientation of the 3 joints as well as
of frame_ia, frame_ib, and frame_im are calculated by solving
analytically a non-linear equation, given the position and
orientation at frame_a and at frame_b.</p>
<p>Connector <strong>frame_a</strong> is the "left" side of the
first revolute joint whereas <strong>frame_ia</strong> is the
"right side of this revolute joint, fixed in rod 1. Connector
<strong>frame_b</strong> is the "right" side of the prismatic joint
whereas <strong>frame_ib</strong> is the "left" side of this
prismatic joint, fixed in rod 2. Finally, connector
<strong>frame_im</strong> is the connector at the "right" side of
the revolute joint in the middle, fixed in rod 2. The frames
frame_b, frame_ib, frame_im are always parallel to each other.</p>
<p>The easiest way to define the parameters of this joint is by
moving the MultiBody system in a <strong>reference
configuration</strong> where <strong>all frames</strong> of all
components are <strong>parallel</strong> to each other
(alternatively, at least frame_a, frame_ia, frame_im, frame_ib,
frame_b of the JointRRP joint should be parallel to each other when
defining an instance of this component).</p>
<p>Basically, the JointRRP model consists internally of a universal
- spherical - prismatic joint aggregation (= JointUSP). In a planar
loop this will behave as if 2 revolute joints with parallel axes
and 1 prismatic joint are connected by rigid rods.</p>
