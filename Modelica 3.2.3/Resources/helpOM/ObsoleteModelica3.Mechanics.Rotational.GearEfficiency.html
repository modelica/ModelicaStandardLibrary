<p>THIS COMPONENT IS <strong>OBSOLETE</strong> and should
<strong>no longer be used</strong>. It is only kept for
<strong>backward compatibility</strong> purposes. Use model
Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.LossyGear instead which implements
gear efficiency in a much more reliable way.</p>
<p>This component consists of two rigidly connected flanges
flange_a and flange_b without inertia where an
<strong>efficiency</strong> coefficient <strong>eta</strong>
reduces the driven torque as function of the driving torque
depending on the direction of the energy flow, i.e., energy is
always lost. This can be seen as a simple model of the Coulomb
friction acting between the teeth of a gearbox.</p>
<p>Note, that most gearbox manufacturers provide tables of the
efficiency of a gearbox as function of the angular velocity
(efficiency becomes zero, if the angular velocity is zero).
However, such a table is practically useless for simulation
purposes, because in gearboxes always two types of friction is
present: (1) Friction in the <strong>bearings</strong> and (2)
friction between the teeth of the gear. (1) leads to a velocity
dependent, additive loss-torque, whereas (2) leads to a
torque-dependent reduction of the driving torque. The gearbox
manufacturers measure both effects together and determine the gear
efficiency from it, although for simulation purposes the two
effects need to be separated. Assume for example that only constant
bearing friction, i.e., bearingTorque=const., is present, i.e.,</p>
<pre>
   (1)  loadTorque = motorTorque - sign(w)*bearingTorque
</pre>
<p>Gearbox manufacturers use the loss-formula</p>
<pre>
   (2)  loadTorque = eta*motorTorque
</pre>
<p>Comparing (1) and (2) gives a formula for the efficiency
eta:</p>
<pre>
   eta = (1 - sign(w)*bearingTorque/motorTorque)
</pre>
<p>When the motorTorque becomes smaller as the bearingTorque, (2)
is useless, because the efficiency is zero. To summarize, be
careful to determine the gear <strong>efficiency</strong> of this
element from tables of the gear manufacturers.</p>
