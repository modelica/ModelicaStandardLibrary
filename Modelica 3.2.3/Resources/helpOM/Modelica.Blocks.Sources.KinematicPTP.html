<p>The goal is to move as <strong>fast</strong> as possible along a
distance <strong>deltaq</strong> under given <strong>kinematical
constraints</strong>. The distance can be a positional or angular
range. In robotics such a movement is called <strong>PTP</strong>
(Point-To-Point). This source block generates the
<strong>acceleration</strong> qdd of this signal as output:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Blocks/Sources/KinematicPTP.png" alt="KinematicPTP.png" /></p>
<p>After integrating the output two times, the position q is
obtained. The signal is constructed in such a way that it is not
possible to move faster, given the <strong>maximally</strong>
allowed <strong>velocity</strong> qd_max and the
<strong>maximally</strong> allowed <strong>acceleration</strong>
qdd_max.</p>
<p>If several distances are given (vector deltaq has more than 1
element), an acceleration output vector is constructed such that
all signals are in the same periods in the acceleration, constant
velocity and deceleration phase. This means that only one of the
signals is at its limits whereas the others are synchronized in
such a way that the end point is reached at the same time
instant.</p>
<p>This element is useful to generate a reference signal for a
controller which controls a drive train or in combination with
model Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.<strong>Accelerate</strong> to
drive a flange according to a given acceleration.</p>
