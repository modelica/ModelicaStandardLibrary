<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This package contains components to model <strong>1-dimensional
translational mechanical</strong> systems, including different
types of masses, external forces, spring/damper elements,
frictional elements, elastogaps, elements to measure position,
velocity, acceleration and the cut-force of a flange. In sublibrary
<strong>Examples</strong> several examples are present to
demonstrate the usage of the elements. Just open the corresponding
example model and simulate the model according to the provided
description.</p>
<p>A unique feature of this library is the
<strong>component-oriented</strong> modeling of <strong>Coulomb
friction</strong> elements, such as support friction. Even
(dynamically) coupled friction elements can be handled
<strong>without</strong> introducing stiffness which leads to fast
simulations. The underlying theory is new and is based on the
solution of mixed continuous/discrete systems of equations, i.e.,
equations where the <strong>unknowns</strong> are of type
<strong>Real</strong>, <strong>Integer</strong> or
<strong>Boolean</strong>. Provided appropriate numerical algorithms
for the solution of such types of systems are available in the
simulation tool, the simulation of (dynamically) coupled friction
elements of this library is <strong>efficient</strong> and
<strong>reliable</strong>.</p>

<p>A simple example of the usage of this library is given in the
figure above. This drive consists of a shaft with mass m1=1 which
is connected via a spring to a second shaft with mass m2=5. The
left shaft is driven via an external, sinusoidal force. The
<strong>filled</strong> and <strong>non-filled green
squares</strong> at the left and right side of a component
represent <strong>mechanical flanges</strong>. Drawing a line
between such squares means that the corresponding flanges are
<strong>rigidly attached</strong> to each other. By convention in
this library, the connector characterized as a
<strong>filled</strong> green square is called
<strong>flange_a</strong> and placed at the left side of the
component in the "design view" and the connector characterized as a
<strong>non-filled</strong> green square is called
<strong>flange_b</strong> and placed at the right side of the
component in the "design view". The two connectors are completely
<strong>identical</strong>, with the only exception that the
graphical layout is a little bit different in order to distinguish
them for easier access of the connector variables. For example,
<code>m1.flange_a.f</code> is the cut-force in the connector
<code>flange_a</code> of component <code>m1</code>.</p>
<p>The components of this library can be <strong>connected</strong>
together in an <strong>arbitrary</strong> way. E.g., it is possible
to connect two springs or two shafts with mass directly together,
see figure below.</p>
