<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Joint with <strong>3 constraints</strong> that define that the
origin of frame_a and the origin of frame_b coincide. By default
this joint defines only the 3 constraints without any potential
states. If parameter <strong>enforceStates</strong> is set to
<strong>true</strong> in the "Advanced" menu, three states are
introduced. Depending on parameter <strong>useQuaternions</strong>
these are either quaternions and the relative angular velocity or 3
angles and the angle derivatives. In the latter case the
orientation of frame_b is computed by rotating frame_a along the
axes defined in parameter vector "sequence_angleStates" (default =
{1,2,3}, i.e., the Cardan angle sequence) around the angles used as
states. For example, the default is to rotate the x-axis of frame_a
around angles[1], the new y-axis around angles[2] and the new
z-axis around angles[3], arriving at frame_b. If angles are used as
states there is the slight disadvantage that a singular
configuration is present leading to a division by zero.</p>
<p>If this joint is used in a <strong>chain</strong> structure, a
Modelica translator has to select orientation coordinates of a body
as states, if the default setting is used. It is usually better to
use relative coordinates in the spherical joint as states, and
therefore in this situation parameter enforceStates might be set to
<strong>true</strong>.</p>
<p>If this joint is used in a <strong>loop</strong> structure, the
default setting results in a <strong>cut-joint</strong> that breaks
the loop in independent kinematic pieces, hold together by the
constraints of this joint. As a result, a Modelica translator will
first try to select 3 generalized coordinates in the joints of the
remaining parts of the loop and their first derivative as states
and if this is not possible, e.g., because there are only spherical
joints in the loop, will select coordinates from a body of the loop
as states.</p>
<p>In the following figure the animation of a spherical joint is
shown. The light blue coordinate system is frame_a and the dark
blue coordinate system is frame_b of the joint. (here: angles_start
= {45, 45, 45}<sup>o</sup>).</p>
