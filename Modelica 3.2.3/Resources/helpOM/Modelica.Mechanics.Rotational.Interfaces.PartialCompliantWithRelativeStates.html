<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This is a 1-dim. rotational component with a compliant
connection of two rotational 1-dim. flanges where inertial effects
between the two flanges are neglected. The basic assumption is that
the cut-torques of the two flanges sum-up to zero, i.e., they have
the same absolute value but opposite sign: flange_a.tau +
flange_b.tau = 0. This base class is used to built up force
elements such as springs, dampers, friction.</p>
<p>The relative angle and the relative speed are defined as
preferred states. The reason is that for some drive trains, such as
drive trains in vehicles, the absolute angle is quickly increasing
during operation. Numerically, it is better to use relative angles
between drive train components because they remain in a limited
size. For this reason, StateSelect.prefer is set for the relative
angle of this component.</p>
<p>In order to improve the numerics, a nominal value for the
relative angle can be provided via parameter
<strong>phi_nominal</strong> in the Advanced menu. The default is
1e-4 rad since relative angles are usually in this order and the
step size control of an integrator would be practically switched
off, if a default of 1 rad would be used. This nominal value might
also be computed from other values, such as "phi_nominal =
tau_nominal / c" for a rotational spring, if tau_nominal and c are
more meaningful for the user.</p>
