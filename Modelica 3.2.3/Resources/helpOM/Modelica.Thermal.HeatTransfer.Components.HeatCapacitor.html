<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This is a generic model for the heat capacity of a material. No
specific geometry is assumed beyond a total volume with uniform
temperature for the entire volume. Furthermore, it is assumed that
the heat capacity is constant (independent of temperature).</p>
<p>The temperature T [Kelvin] of this component is a
<strong>state</strong>. A default of T = 25 degree Celsius (=
SIunits.Conversions.from_degC(25)) is used as start value for
initialization. This usually means that at start of integration the
temperature of this component is 25 degrees Celsius. You may, of
course, define a different temperature as start value for
initialization. Alternatively, it is possible to set parameter
<strong>steadyStateStart</strong> to <strong>true</strong>. In this
case the additional equation '<strong>der</strong>(T) = 0' is used
during initialization, i.e., the temperature T is computed in such
a way that the component starts in <strong>steady state</strong>.
This is useful in cases, where one would like to start simulation
in a suitable operating point without being forced to integrate for
a long time to arrive at this point.</p>
<p>Note, that parameter <strong>steadyStateStart</strong> is not
available in the parameter menu of the simulation window, because
its value is utilized during translation to generate quite
different equations depending on its setting. Therefore, the value
of this parameter can only be changed before translating the
model.</p>
<p>This component may be used for complicated geometries where the
heat capacity C is determined my measurements. If the component
consists mainly of one type of material, the <strong>mass
m</strong> of the component may be measured or calculated and
multiplied with the <strong>specific heat capacity cp</strong> of
the component material to compute C:</p>
<pre>
   C = cp*m.
   Typical values for cp at 20 degC in J/(kg.K):
      aluminium   896
      concrete    840
      copper      383
      iron        452
      silver      235
      steel       420 ... 500 (V2A)
      wood       2500
