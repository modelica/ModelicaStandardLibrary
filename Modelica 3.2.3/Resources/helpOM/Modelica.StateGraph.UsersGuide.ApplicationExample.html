<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>In this section a more realistic, still simple, application
example is given, to demonstrate various features of the StateGraph
library. This example shows the control of a two tank system from
the master thesis of Isolde Dressler (<a href="Modelica.StateGraph.UsersGuide.Literature.html">see
literature</a>).</p>
<p>In the following figure the top level of the model is shown.
This model is available as StateGraph.Examples.ControlledTanks.</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/StateGraph/Examples/ControlledTanks1.png"/></p>
<p>In the right part of the figure, two tanks are shown. At the top
part, a large fluid source is present from which fluid can be
filled in <strong>tank1</strong> when <strong>valve1</strong> is
open. Tank1 can be emptied via <strong>valve2</strong> that is
located in the bottom of tank2 and fills a second
<strong>tank2</strong> which in turn is emptied via
<strong>valve3</strong>. The actual levels of the tanks are
measured and are provided as signals <strong>level1</strong> and
<strong>level2</strong> to the <strong>tankController</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>tankController</strong> is controlled by three
buttons, <strong>start</strong>, <strong>stop</strong> and
<strong>shut</strong> (for shutdown) that are mutually exclusive.
This means that whenever one button is pressed (i.e., its state is
<strong>true</strong>) then the other two buttons are not pressed
(i.e., their states are <strong>false</strong>). When button
<strong>start</strong> is pressed, the "normal" operation to fill
and to empty the two tanks is processed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Valve 1 is opened and tank 1 is filled.</li>
<li>When tank 1 reaches its fill level limit, valve 1 is
closed.</li>
<li>After a waiting time, valve 2 is opened and the fluid flows
from tank 1 into tank 2.</li>
<li>When tank 1 is empty, valve 2 is closed.</li>
<li>After a waiting time, valve 3 is opened and the fluid flows out
of tank 2</li>
<li>When tank 2 is empty, valve 3 is closed</li>
</ol>
<p>The above "normal" process can be influenced by the following
buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Button <strong>start</strong> starts the above process. When
this button is pressed after a "stop" or "shut" operation, the
process operation continues.</li>
<li>Button <strong>stop</strong> stops the above process by closing
all valves. Then, the controller waits for further input (either
"start" or "shut" operation).</li>
<li>Button <strong>shut</strong> is used to shutdown the process,
by emptying at once both tanks. When this is achieved, the process
goes back to its start configuration. Clicking on "start", restarts
the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>The implementation of the <strong>tankController</strong> is
shown in the next figure:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/StateGraph/Examples/ControlledTanks2.png"/></p>
<p>When the "<strong>start</strong>" button is pressed, the
stateGraph is within the CompositeStep
"<strong>makeProduct</strong>". During normal operation this
CompositeStep is only left, once tank2 is empty. Afterwards, the
CompositeStep is at once re-entered.</p>
<p>When the "<strong>stop</strong>" button is pressed, the
"makeProduct" CompositeStep is at once terminated via the
"<strong>suspend</strong>" port and the stateGraph waits in step
"<strong>s2</strong>" for further commands. When the
"<strong>start</strong>" button is pressed, the CompositeStep is
re-entered via its <strong>resume</strong> port and the "normal"
operation continues at the state where it was aborted by the
suspend transition. If the "<strong>shut</strong>" button is
pressed, the stateGraph waits in the "<strong>emptyTanks</strong>"
step, until both tanks are empty and then waits at the initial step
"<strong>s1</strong>" for further input.</p>
<p>The opening and closing of valves is <strong>not</strong>
directly defined in the stateGraph. Instead via the
"<strong>setValveX</strong>" components, the Boolean state of the
valves are computed. For example, the output y of "setValve2" is
computed as:</p>
<pre>
  y = makeProduct.fillTank2.active or emptyTanks.active
</pre>
<p>i.e., valve2 is open, when step "makeProduct.fillTank2 or when
step "emptyTanks" is active. Otherwise, valve2 is closed.</p>
