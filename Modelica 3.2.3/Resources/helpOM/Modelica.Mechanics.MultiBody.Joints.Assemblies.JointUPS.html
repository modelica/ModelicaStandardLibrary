<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This component consists of a <strong>universal</strong> joint at
frame_a, a <strong>spherical</strong> joint at frame_b and a
<strong>prismatic</strong> joint along the line connecting the
origin of frame_a and the origin of frame_b, see the default
animation in the following figure (the axes vectors are not part of
the default animation):</p>

<p>This joint aggregation has no mass and no inertia and introduces
neither constraints nor potential state variables. It is especially
useful to build up more complicated force elements where the mass
and/or inertia of the force element shall be taken into
account.</p>
<p>The universal joint is defined in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rotation <strong>axis</strong> of revolute joint
<strong>1</strong> is along parameter vector n1_a which is fixed in
frame_a.</li>
<li>The rotation <strong>axis</strong> of revolute joint
<strong>2</strong> is perpendicular to axis 1 and to the line
connecting the universal and the spherical joint.</li>
</ul>
<p>The definition of axis 2 of the universal joint is performed
according to the most often occurring case. In a future release,
axis 2 might be explicitly definable via a parameter. However, the
treatment is much more complicated and the number of operations is
considerably higher, if axis 2 is not orthogonal to axis 1 and to
the connecting rod.</p>
<p>Note, there is a <strong>singularity</strong> when axis 1 and
the connecting line are parallel to each other. Therefore, if
possible n1_a should be selected in such a way that it is
perpendicular to nAxis_ia in the initial configuration (i.e., the
distance to the singularity is as large as possible).</p>
<p>An additional <strong>frame_ia</strong> is present. It is
<strong>fixed</strong> on the line connecting the universal and the
spherical joint at the origin of <strong>frame_a</strong>. The
placement of frame_ia on this line is implicitly defined by the
universal joint (frame_a and frame_ia coincide when the angles of
the two revolute joints of the universal joint are zero) and by
parameter vector <strong>nAxis_ia</strong>, an axis vector directed
along the line from the origin of frame_a to the spherical joint,
resolved in frame_<strong>ia</strong>.</p>
<p>An additional <strong>frame_ib</strong> is present. It is
<strong>fixed</strong> in the line connecting the prismatic and the
spherical joint at the origin of <strong>frame_b</strong>. It is
always parallel to <strong>frame_ia</strong>.</p>
<p>Note, this joint aggregation can be used in cases where in
reality a rod with spherical joints at each end are present. Such a
system has an additional degree of freedom to rotate the rod along
its axis. In practice this rotation is usually of no interest and
is mathematically removed by replacing one of the spherical joints
by a universal joint.</p>
<p>The easiest way to define the parameters of this joint is by
moving the MultiBody system in a <strong>reference
configuration</strong> where <strong>all frames</strong> of all
components are <strong>parallel</strong> to each other
(alternatively, at least frame_a, frame_ia and frame_ib of the
JointUSP joint should be parallel to each other when defining an
instance of this component).</p>
