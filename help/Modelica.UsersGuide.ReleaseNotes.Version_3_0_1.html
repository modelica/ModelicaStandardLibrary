<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This Modelica package is provided under the <a href="Modelica.UsersGuide.ModelicaLicense2.html">Modelica License
2</a> and no longer under Modelica License 1.1. There are the
following reasons why the Modelica Association changes from
Modelica License 1.1 to this new license text (note, the text below
is not a legal interpretation of the Modelica License 2. In case of
a conflict, the language of the license shall prevail):</p>
<ol>
<li>The rights of licensor and licensee are much more clearly
defined. For example:
<ul>
<li>The licensed work (Original Work) can be used in unmodified
form in open source and commercial software (the licensee cannot
change the license and the work must be provided without fees)</li>
<li>If a model component is copied out of a Modelica package under
Modelica License 2 and is modified in order to adapt it to the
needs of the modeler, then the result can be licensed under any
license (including a commercial license).</li>
<li>It is practically not possible to change the license of a
Modelica package under Modelica License 2 to another license, i.e.,
a licensee cannot change the license by adding material or changing
classes, so the work must remain under Modelica License 2 (to be
more precise, if the licensee makes modifications to the Original
Work "which represents, as a whole, an original work of
authorship", he/she can change the license to another license.
However, for a Modelica package this would require a lot of changes
which is usually unrealistic).</li>
<li>If an executable is constructed using a Modelica package under
Modelica License 2, then this executable can be licensed under any
license (including a commercial license).</li>
</ul>
We hope that this compromise between open source contributors,
commercial Modelica environments and Modelica users will motivate
even more people to provide their Modelica packages freely under
the Modelica License 2.<br />
<br /></li>
<li>There are several new provisions that shall make law suites
against licensors and licensees more unlikely (so the small risk is
further reduced).</li>
</ol>

<td valign="top">BaseProperties.p was not defined as preferred
state and BaseProperties.T was always defined as preferred state.
This has been fixed by Defining p,T as preferred state if parameter
preferredMediumState = true. This error had the effect that mass m
is selected as state instead of p and if default initialization is
used then m=0 could give not the expected behavior. This means,
simulation is not wrong but the numerics is not as good and if a
model relies on default initial values, the result could be not as
expected.</td>
