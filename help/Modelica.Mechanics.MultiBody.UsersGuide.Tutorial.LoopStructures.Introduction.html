<p>In principal, now special action is needed, if loop structures
occur (contrary to the ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody library). An
example is presented in the figure below. It is available as
<a href="Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Examples.Loops.Fourbar1.html">MultiBody.Examples.Loops.Fourbar1</a></p>

<p>This mechanism consists of 6 revolute joints, 1 prismatic joint
and forms a kinematical loop. It has has one degree of freedom. In
the next figure the default animation is shown. Note, that the axes
of the revolute joints are represented by the red cylinders and
that the axis of the prismatic joint is represented by the red box
on the lower right side.</p>

<p>Whenever loop structures occur, non-linear algebraic equations
are present on "position level". It is then usually not possible by
structural analysis to select states during translation (which is
possible for non-loop structures). In the example above, Dymola
detects a non-linear algebraic loop of 57 equations and reduces
this to a system of 7 coupled algebraic equations. Note, that this
is performed without using any "cut-joints" as it is usually done
in multi-body programs, but by just appropriate symbolic equation
manipulation. Via the dynamic dummy derivative method the
generalized coordinates on position and velocity level from one of
the 7 joints are dynamically selected as states during simulation.
Whenever, these two states are no longer appropriate, states from
one of the other joints are selected during simulation.</p>
<p>The efficiency of loop structures can usually be enhanced, if
states are statically fixed at translation time. For this
mechanism, the generalized coordinates of joint j1 (i.e., the
rotation angle of the revolute joint and its derivative) can always
be used as states. This can be stated by setting parameter
"enforceStates = <b>true</b>" in the "Advanced" menu of the desired
joint. This flag sets the attribute stateSelect of the generalized
coordinates of the corresponding joint to "StateSelect.always".
When setting this flag to <b>true</b> for joint j1 in the four bar
mechanism, Dymola detects a non-linear algebraic loop of 40
equations and reduces this to a system of 5 coupled non-linear
algebraic equations.</p>
<p>In many mechanisms it is possible to solve the non-linear
algebraic equations analytically. For a certain class of systems
this can be performed also with the MultiBody library. This
technique is described in section "<a href="Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.UsersGuide.Tutorial.LoopStructures.AnalyticLoopHandling.html">Analytic
loop handling</a>".</p>
