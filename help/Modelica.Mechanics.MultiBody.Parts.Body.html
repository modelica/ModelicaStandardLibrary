<p><b>Rigid body</b> with mass and inertia tensor. All parameter
vectors have to be resolved in frame_a. The <b>inertia tensor</b>
has to be defined with respect to a coordinate system that is
parallel to frame_a with the origin at the center of mass of the
body.</p>
<p>By default, this component is visualized by a <b>cylinder</b>
located between frame_a and the center of mass and by a
<b>sphere</b> that has its center at the center of mass. If the
cylinder length is smaller as the radius of the sphere, e.g., since
frame_a is located at the center of mass, the cylinder is not
displayed. Note, that the animation may be switched off via
parameter animation = <b>false</b>.</p>

<p><b>States of Body Components</b></p>
<p>Every body has potential states. If possible a tool will select
the states of joints and not the states of bodies because this is
usually the most efficient choice. In this case the position,
orientation, velocity and angular velocity of frame_a of the body
will be computed by the component that is connected to frame_a.
However, if a body is moving freely in space, variables of the body
have to be used as states. The potential states of the body
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>position vector</b> frame_a.r_0 from the origin of the
world frame to the origin of frame_a of the body, resolved in the
world frame and the <b>absolute velocity</b> v_0 of the origin of
frame_a, resolved in the world frame (= der(frame_a.r_0)).</li>
<li>If parameter <b>useQuaternions</b> in the "Advanced" menu is
<b>true</b> (this is the default), then <b>4 quaternions</b> are
potential states. Additionally, the coordinates of the absolute
angular velocity vector of the body are 3 potential states.<br />
If <b>useQuaternions</b> in the "Advanced" menu is <b>false</b>,
then <b>3 angles</b> and the derivatives of these angles are
potential states. The orientation of frame_a is computed by
rotating the world frame along the axes defined in parameter vector
"sequence_angleStates" (default = {1,2,3}, i.e., the Cardan angle
sequence) around the angles used as potential states. For example,
the default is to rotate the x-axis of the world frame around
angles[1], the new y-axis around angles[2] and the new z-axis
around angles[3], arriving at frame_a.</li>
</ul>
<p>The quaternions have the slight disadvantage that there is a
non-linear constraint equation between the 4 quaternions.
Therefore, at least one non-linear equation has to be solved during
simulation. A tool might, however, analytically solve this simple
constraint equation. Using the 3 angles as states has the
disadvantage that there is a singular configuration in which a
division by zero will occur. If it is possible to determine in
advance for an application class that this singular configuration
is outside of the operating region, the 3 angles might be used as
potential states by setting <b>useQuaternions</b> =
<b>false</b>.</p>
<p>In text books about 3-dimensional mechanics often 3 angles and
the angular velocity are used as states. This is not the case here,
since 3 angles and their derivatives are used as potential states
(if useQuaternions = false). The reason is that for real-time
simulation the discretization formula of the integrator might be
"inlined" and solved together with the body equations. By
appropriate symbolic transformation the performance is drastically
increased if angles and their derivatives are used as states,
instead of angles and the angular velocity.</p>
<p>Whether or not variables of the body are used as states is
usually automatically selected by the Modelica translator. If
parameter <b>enforceStates</b> is set to <b>true</b> in the
"Advanced" menu, then body variables are forced to be used as
states according to the setting of parameters "useQuaternions" and
"sequence_angleStates".</p>
