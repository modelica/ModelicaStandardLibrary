<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This block generates an output signal y[:] by <b>linear
interpolation</b> in a table. The time points and function values
are stored in a matrix <b>table[i,j]</b>, where the first column
table[:,1] contains the time points and the other columns contain
the data to be interpolated.</p>
<p><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Blocks/Sources/CombiTimeTable.png" alt="CombiTimeTable.png" /></p>
<p>Via parameter <b>columns</b> it can be defined which columns of
the table are interpolated. If, e.g., columns={2,4}, it is assumed
that 2 output signals are present and that the first output is
computed by interpolation of column 2 and the second output is
computed by interpolation of column 4 of the table matrix. The
table interpolation has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The time points need to be <b>strictly increasing</b> if
smoothness is ContinuousDerivative, otherwise <b>monotonically
increasing</b>.</li>
<li><b>Discontinuities</b> are allowed, by providing the same time
point twice in the table.</li>
<li>Values <b>outside</b> of the table range, are computed by
extrapolation according to the setting of parameter
<b>extrapolation</b>:
<pre>
  extrapolation = 1: hold the first or last value of the table,
                     if outside of the table scope.
                = 2: extrapolate by using the derivative at the first/last table
                     points if outside of the table scope.
                     (If smoothness is LinearSegments or ConstantSegments
                     this means to extrapolate linearly through the first/last
                     two table points.).
                = 3: periodically repeat the table data
                     (periodical function).
                = 4: no extrapolation, i.e. extrapolation triggers an error
</pre></li>
<li>Via parameter <b>smoothness</b> it is defined how the data is
interpolated:
<pre>
  smoothness = 1: linear interpolation
             = 2: smooth interpolation with Akima-splines such
                  that der(y) is continuous, also if extrapolated.
             = 3: constant segments
</pre></li>
<li>If the table has only <b>one row</b>, no interpolation is
performed and the table values of this row are just returned.</li>
<li>Via parameters <b>startTime</b> and <b>offset</b> the curve
defined by the table can be shifted both in time and in the
ordinate value. The time instants stored in the table are therefore
<b>relative</b> to <b>startTime</b>. If time &lt; startTime, no
interpolation is performed and the offset is used as ordinate value
for all outputs.</li>
<li>The table is implemented in a numerically sound way by
generating <b>time events</b> at interval boundaries. This
generates continuously differentiable values for the
integrator.</li>
<li>For special applications it is sometimes needed to know the
minimum and maximum time instant defined in the table as a
parameter. For this reason parameters <b>t_min</b> and <b>t_max</b>
are provided and can be accessed from the outside of the table
object.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
   table = [0  0
            1  0
            1  1
            2  4
            3  9
            4 16]; extrapolation = 3 (default)
If, e.g., time = 1.0, the output y =  0.0 (before event), 1.0 (after event)
    e.g., time = 1.5, the output y =  2.5,
    e.g., time = 2.0, the output y =  4.0,
    e.g., time = 5.0, the output y = 23.0 (i.e., extrapolation via last 2 points).
</pre>
<p>The table matrix can be defined in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explicitly supplied as <b>parameter matrix</b> "table", and the
other parameters have the following values:
<pre>
   tableName is "NoName" or has only blanks,
   fileName  is "NoName" or has only blanks.
</pre></li>
<li><b>Read</b> from a <b>file</b> "fileName" where the matrix is
stored as "tableName". Both ASCII and MAT-file format is possible.
(The ASCII format is described below). The MAT-file format comes in
four different versions: v4, v6, v7 and v7.3. The library supports
at least v4, v6 and v7 whereas v7.3 is optional. It is most
convenient to generate the MAT-file from FreeMat or MATLAB® by
command
<pre>
   save tables.mat tab1 tab2 tab3
</pre>
or Scilab by command
<pre>
   savematfile tables.mat tab1 tab2 tab3
</pre>
when the three tables tab1, tab2, tab3 should be used from the
model.<br />
Note, a fileName can be defined as URI by using the helper function
<a href="Modelica.Utilities.Files.loadResource.html">loadResource</a>.</li>
<li>Statically stored in function "usertab" in file "usertab.c".
The matrix is identified by "tableName". Parameter fileName =
"NoName" or has only blanks. Row-wise storage is always to be
preferred as otherwise the table is reallocated and
transposed.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the constant "NO_FILE_SYSTEM" is defined, all file I/O
related parts of the source code are removed by the C-preprocessor,
such that no access to files takes place.</p>
<p>If tables are read from an ASCII-file, the file needs to have
the following structure ("-----" is not part of the file
content):</p>
<pre>
-----------------------------------------------------
#1
double tab1(6,2)   # comment line
  0   0
  1   0
  1   1
  2   4
  3   9
  4  16
double tab2(6,2)   # another comment line
  0   0
  2   0
  2   2
  4   8
  6  18
  8  32
-----------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>Note, that the first two characters in the file need to be "#1"
(a line comment defining the version number of the file format).
Afterwards, the corresponding matrix has to be declared with type
(= "double" or "float"), name and actual dimensions. Finally, in
successive rows of the file, the elements of the matrix have to be
given. The elements have to be provided as a sequence of numbers in
row-wise order (therefore a matrix row can span several lines in
the file and need not start at the beginning of a line). Numbers
have to be given according to C syntax (such as 2.3, -2, +2.e4).
Number separators are spaces, tab ( ), comma (,), or semicolon (;).
Several matrices may be defined one after another. Line comments
start with the hash symbol (#) and can appear everywhere. Other
characters, like trailing non comments, are not allowed in the
file.</p>
