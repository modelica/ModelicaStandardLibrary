<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>The M_OLine is a multi line model which consists of several
segments and several single lines. Each segment consists of
resistors and inductors that are connected in series in each single
line, and of capacitors and conductors both between the lines and
to the ground. The inductors are coupled to each other like in the
M_Inductor model. The following picture shows the schematic of a
segment with four single lines (lines=4):</p>
<blockquote><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Electrical/Analog/segment.png" alt="segment.png" /></blockquote>
<p>The complete multi line consists of N segments and an auxiliary
segment_last:</p>
<p align="center"><code>-- segment_1 -- segment_2 -- ... --
segment_N -- segment_last --</code></p>
<p>In the picture of the segment can be seen, that a single segment
is asymmetric. Connecting such asymmetric segments in a series
forces also an asymmetric multi line. To get a symmetric model
which is useful for coupling and which guaranties the same pin
properties, in the segment_1 only half valued resistors and
inductors are used. The remaining resistors and inductors are at
the other end of the line within the auxiliary segment_last. For
the example with 4 lines the schematic of segment_last is like
this:</p>
<blockquote><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Electrical/Analog/segment_last.png" alt="segment_last.png" /></blockquote>
<p>The number of the capacitors and conductors depends on the
number of single lines that are used, because each line is
connected to every other line by both a capacitor and a conductor.
One line consists of <b>at least two segments</b>. Inside the model
M_OLine the model <i>segment</i> is used. This model represents one
segment which is build as described above. For modelling the
inductances and their mutual couplings the model M_Transformer is
used. To fill the resistance vector, resistance values as many as
lines are needed, e.g., if there are four lines, four resistances
are needed. For example for a microelectronic line of 0.1m length,
a sensible resistance-vector would be R=[4.76e5, 1.72e5, 1.72e5,
1.72e5].</p>
<p>Filling the matrices of the inductances, capacitances and
conductances is a bit more complicated, because those components
occur also between two lines and not only (like the resistor) in
one line. The entries of the matrices are given by the user in form
of a vector. The vector length dim_vector_lgc is calculated by
<b>dim_vector_lgc = lines*(lines+1)/2</b>. Inside the model a
symmetric inductance matrix, a symmetric capacitance matrix and a
symmetric conductance matrix are built out of the entries of the
vectors given by the user. The way of building is the same for each
matrix, so the approach for filling one of the matrices will be
shown at an example:</p>
<p>The number of lines is assumed to be four. To build the matrix,
the model needs the values from the main diagonal and from the
positions that are below the main diagonal. To get the following
matrix</p>
<blockquote><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Electrical/Analog/Lines/M_OLine-eqMatrix.png" alt="Matrix" /></blockquote>
<p>the vector with dim_vector_lgc=4*5/2=10 has to appear in the
following way: vector = [<b>1</b>, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, <b>2</b>, 0.3
0.5, <b>3</b>, 0.6, <b>4</b>]</p>
<p>For the example of a microelectronic line of 0.1m length, which
is used as default example for the M_OLine model, a sensible
inductance-matrix would be</p>
<blockquote><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Electrical/Analog/Lines/M_OLine-eqL.png" alt="L" /></blockquote>
<p>For the example of a microelectronic line of 0.1m length, which
is used as default example for the M_OLine model, a sensible
capacitance-matrix would be:</p>
<blockquote><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Electrical/Analog/Lines/M_OLine-eqC.png" alt="C" /></blockquote>
<p>For the example of a microelectronic line of 0.1m length, which
is used as default example for the M_OLine model, a sensible
conductance-matrix would be:</p>
<blockquote><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Electrical/Analog/Lines/M_OLine-eqG.png" alt="G" /></blockquote>
<p>The user has the possibility to enable a conditional heatport.
If so, the M_OLine can be connected to a thermal network. When the
parameter alpha is set to an value greater then zero, the M_OLine
becomes temperature sensitive due to their resistors which
resistances are calculated by R = R_ref*(1 + alpha*(heatPort.T -
T_ref)) and conductors calculated by (G_actual = G_ref/(1 +
alpha*(T_heatPort - T_ref)).</p>
