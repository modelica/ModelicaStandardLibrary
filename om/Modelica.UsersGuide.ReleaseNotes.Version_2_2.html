<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Version 2.2 is backward compatible to version 2.1.</p>
<p>The following <b>new libraries</b> have been added:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr>
<td valign="top"><a href="Modelica.Media.html">Modelica.Media</a></td>
<td valign="top">Property models of liquids and gases, especially
<ul>
<li>1241 detailed gas models,</li>
<li>moist air,</li>
<li>high precision water model (according to IAPWS/IF97
standard),</li>
<li>incompressible media defined by tables (cp(T), rho(t), eta(T),
etc. are defined by tables).</li>
</ul>
The user can conveniently define mixtures of gases between the 1241
gas models. The models are designed to work well in dynamic
simulations. They are based on a new standard interface for media
with single and multiple substances and one or multiple phases with
the following features:
<ul>
<li>The independent variables of a medium model do not influence
the definition of a fluid connector port or how the balance
equations have to be implemented.<br />
Used independent variables: "p,T", "p,T,X", "p,h", "d,T".</li>
<li>Optional variables, e.g., dynamic viscosity, are only computed
if needed.</li>
<li>The medium models are implemented with regards to efficient
dynamic simulation.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><a href="Modelica.Thermal.FluidHeatFlow.html">Modelica.Thermal.FluidHeatFlow</a></td>
<td valign="top">Simple components for 1-dim., incompressible
thermo-fluid flow to model coolant flows, e.g., of electrical
machines. Components can be connected arbitrarily together (= ideal
mixing at connection points) and fluid may reverse direction of
flow.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The following <b>changes</b> have been performed in the
<b>Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody</b> library:</p>
<ul>
<li>Component MultiBody.World has a new parameter
<b>driveTrainMechanics3D</b>. If set to <b>true</b>, 3D mechanical
effects of MultiBody.Parts.Mounting1D/Rotor1D/BevelGear1D are taken
into account. If set to <b>false</b> (= default), 3D mechanical
effects in these elements are not taken into account and the frame
connectors to connect to 3D parts are disabled (all connections to
such a disabled connector are also disabled, due to the new feature
of conditional declarations in Modelica language 2.2)</li>
<li>All references to "MultiBody.xxx" have been changed to
"Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBodys.xxx" in order that after copying of
a component outside of the Modelica library, the references still
remain valid.</li>
</ul>
