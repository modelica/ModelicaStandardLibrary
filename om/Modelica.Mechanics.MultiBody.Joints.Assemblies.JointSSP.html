<p>This component consists of a <b>spherical</b> joint 1 at
frame_a, a <b>prismatic</b> joint at frame_b and a <b>spherical</b>
joint 2 which is connected via rod 1 to the spherical joint 1 and
via rod 2 to the prismatic joint, see the default animation in the
following figure (the axes vectors are not part of the default
animation):</p>

<p>Besides an optional point mass in the middle of rod 1, this
joint aggregation has no mass and no inertia, and introduces
neither constraints nor potential state variables. It should be
used in kinematic loops whenever possible since the non-linear
system of equations introduced by this joint aggregation is solved
<b>analytically</b> (i.e., a solution is always computed, if a
unique solution exists).</p>
<p>An additional <b>frame_ib</b> is present. It is <b>fixed</b> in
rod 2 connecting the prismatic and the spherical joint at the side
of the prismatic joint that is connected to this rod (=
rod2.frame_a = prismatic.frame_a).</p>
<p>An additional <b>frame_im</b> is present. It is <b>fixed</b> in
rod 2 connecting the prismatic and the spherical joint at the side
of spherical joint 2 that is connected to this rod (=
rod2.frame_b). It is always parallel to <b>frame_ib</b>.</p>
<p>The easiest way to define the parameters of this joint is by
moving the MultiBody system in a <b>reference configuration</b>
where <b>all frames</b> of all components are <b>parallel</b> to
each other (alternatively, at least frame_b and frame_ib of the
JointSSP joint should be parallel to each other when defining an
instance of this component).</p>
