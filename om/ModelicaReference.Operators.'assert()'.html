<p>Trigger error and print error message if assertion condition is
not fulfilled</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<blockquote><code><b>assert</b>(condition, message, level =
AssertionLevel.error)</code></blockquote>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The Boolean expression <i>condition</i> shall be true for
successful model evaluations. Otherwise, an error occurs using the
string expression <i>message</i> as error message.</p>
<p>If the condition of an assert statement is true, message is not
evaluated and the procedure call is ignored. If the condition
evaluates to false different actions are taken depending on the
level input:</p>
<ul>
<li>level = AssertionLevel.error:<br />
The current evaluation is aborted. The simulation may continue with
another evaluation [e.g., with a shorter step-size, or by changing
the values of iteration variables]. If the simulation is aborted,
message indicates the cause of the error. Failed assertions takes
precedence over successful termination, such that if the model
first triggers the end of successful analysis by reaching the
stop-time or explicitly with terminate(), but the evaluation with
terminal()=true triggers an assert, the analysis failed.</li>
<li>level = AssertionLevel.warning:<br />
The current evaluation is not aborted. message indicates the cause
of the warning [It is recommended to report the warning only once
when the condition becomes false, and it is reported that the
condition is no longer violated when the condition returns to true.
The assert(..) statement shall have no influence on the behavior of
the model. For example, by evaluating the condition and reporting
the message only after accepted integrator steps. condition needs
to be implicitly treated with noEvent(..) since otherwise events
might be triggered that can lead to slightly changed simulation
results].</li>
</ul>
<p>The AssertionLevel.error case can be used to avoid evaluating a
model outside its limits of validity; for instance, a function to
compute the saturated liquid temperature cannot be called with a
pressure lower than the triple point value. The
AssertionLevel.warning case can be used when the boundary of
validity is not hard: for instance, a fluid property model based on
a polynomial interpolation curve might give accurate results
between temperatures of 250 K and 400 K, but still give reasonable
results in the range 200 K and 500 K. When the temperature gets out
of the smaller interval, but still stays in the largest one, the
user should be warned, but the simulation should continue without
any further action. The corresponding code would be</p>
<pre>
  <b>assert</b>(T &gt; 250 and T &lt; 400, "Medium model outside full accuracy range",
         AssertionLevel.warning);
  <b>assert</b>(T &gt; 200 and T &lt; 500, "Medium model outside feasible region");
</pre>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<pre>
  <b>parameter</b> Real upperLimit=2;
  <b>parameter</b> Real lowerLimit=-2;
<b>equation</b>
  <b>assert</b>(upperLimit &gt; lowerLimit, "upperLimit must be greater than lowerLimit.");
</pre>
