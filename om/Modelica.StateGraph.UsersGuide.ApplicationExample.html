<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>In this section a more realistic, still simple, application
example is given, to demonstrate various features of the StateGraph
library. This example shows the control of a two tank system from
the master thesis of Isolde Dressler (<a href="Modelica.StateGraph.UsersGuide.Literature.html">see
literature</a>).</p>
<p>In the following figure the top level of the model is shown.
This model is available as StateGraph.Examples.ControlledTanks.</p>
<p><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/StateGraph/Examples/ControlledTanks1.png" /></p>
<p>In the right part of the figure, two tanks are shown. At the top
part, a large fluid source is present from which fluid can be
filled in <b>tank1</b> when <b>valve1</b> is open. Tank1 can be
emptied via <b>valve2</b> that is located in the bottom of tank2
and fills a second <b>tank2</b> which in turn is emptied via
<b>valve3</b>. The actual levels of the tanks are measured and are
provided as signals <b>level1</b> and <b>level2</b> to the
<b>tankController</b>.</p>
<p>The <b>tankController</b> is controlled by three buttons,
<b>start</b>, <b>stop</b> and <b>shut</b> (for shutdown) that are
mutually exclusive. This means that whenever one button is pressed
(i.e., its state is <b>true</b>) then the other two buttons are not
pressed (i.e., their states are <b>false</b>). When button
<b>start</b> is pressed, the "normal" operation to fill and to
empty the two tanks is processed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Valve 1 is opened and tank 1 is filled.</li>
<li>When tank 1 reaches its fill level limit, valve 1 is
closed.</li>
<li>After a waiting time, valve 2 is opened and the fluid flows
from tank 1 into tank 2.</li>
<li>When tank 1 is empty, valve 2 is closed.</li>
<li>After a waiting time, valve 3 is opened and the fluid flows out
of tank 2</li>
<li>When tank 2 is empty, valve 3 is closed</li>
</ol>
<p>The above "normal" process can be influenced by the following
buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Button <b>start</b> starts the above process. When this button
is pressed after a "stop" or "shut" operation, the process
operation continues.</li>
<li>Button <b>stop</b> stops the above process by closing all
valves. Then, the controller waits for further input (either
"start" or "shut" operation).</li>
<li>Button <b>shut</b> is used to shutdown the process, by emptying
at once both tanks. When this is achieved, the process goes back to
its start configuration. Clicking on "start", restarts the
process.</li>
</ul>
<p>The implementation of the <b>tankController</b> is shown in the
next figure:</p>
<p><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/StateGraph/Examples/ControlledTanks2.png" /></p>
<p>When the "<b>start</b>" button is pressed, the stateGraph is
within the CompositeStep "<b>makeProduct</b>". During normal
operation this CompositeStep is only left, once tank2 is empty.
Afterwards, the CompositeStep is at once re-entered.</p>
<p>When the "<b>stop</b>" button is pressed, the "makeProduct"
CompositeStep is at once terminated via the "<b>suspend</b>" port
and the stateGraph waits in step "<b>s2</b>" for further commands.
When the "<b>start</b>" button is pressed, the CompositeStep is
re-entered via its <b>resume</b> port and the "normal" operation
continues at the state where it was aborted by the suspend
transition. If the "<b>shut</b>" button is pressed, the stateGraph
waits in the "<b>emptyTanks</b>" step, until both tanks are empty
and then waits at the initial step "<b>s1</b>" for further
input.</p>
<p>The opening and closing of valves is <b>not</b> directly defined
in the stateGraph. Instead via the "<b>setValveX</b>" components,
the Boolean state of the valves are computed. For example, the
output y of "setValve2" is computed as:</p>
<pre>
  y = makeProduct.fillTank2.active or emptyTanks.active
</pre>
<p>i.e., valve2 is open, when step "makeProduct.fillTank2 or when
step "emptyTanks" is active. Otherwise, valve2 is closed.</p>
