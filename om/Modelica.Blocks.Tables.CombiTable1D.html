<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p><b>Linear interpolation</b> in <b>one</b> dimension of a
<b>table</b>. Via parameter <b>columns</b> it can be defined how
many columns of the table are interpolated. If, e.g.,
columns={2,4}, it is assumed that 2 input and 2 output signals are
present and that the first output interpolates the first input via
column 2 and the second output interpolates the second input via
column 4 of the table matrix.</p>
<p>The grid points and function values are stored in a matrix
"table[i,j]", where the first column "table[:,1]" contains the grid
points and the other columns contain the data to be interpolated.
Example:</p>
<pre>
   table = [0,  0;
            1,  1;
            2,  4;
            4, 16]
   If, e.g., the input u = 1.0, the output y =  1.0,
       e.g., the input u = 1.5, the output y =  2.5,
       e.g., the input u = 2.0, the output y =  4.0,
       e.g., the input u =-1.0, the output y = -1.0 (i.e., extrapolation).
</pre>
<ul>
<li>The interpolation is <b>efficient</b>, because a search for a
new interpolation starts at the interval used in the last
call.</li>
<li>If the table has only <b>one row</b>, the table value is
returned, independent of the value of the input signal.</li>
<li>If the input signal <b>u[i]</b> is <b>outside</b> of the
defined <b>interval</b>, i.e., u[i] &gt; table[size(table,1),i+1]
or u[i] &lt; table[1,1], the corresponding value is also determined
by linear interpolation through the last or first two points of the
table.</li>
<li>The grid values (first column) have to be strictly
increasing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The table matrix can be defined in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explicitly supplied as <b>parameter matrix</b> "table", and the
other parameters have the following values:
<pre>
   tableName is "NoName" or has only blanks,
   fileName  is "NoName" or has only blanks.
</pre></li>
<li><b>Read</b> from a <b>file</b> "fileName" where the matrix is
stored as "tableName". Both ASCII and MAT-file format is possible.
(The ASCII format is described below). The MAT-file format comes in
four different versions: v4, v6, v7 and v7.3. The library supports
at least v4, v6 and v7 whereas v7.3 is optional. It is most
convenient to generate the MAT-file from FreeMat or MATLAB® by
command
<pre>
   save tables.mat tab1 tab2 tab3
</pre>
or Scilab by command
<pre>
   savematfile tables.mat tab1 tab2 tab3
</pre>
when the three tables tab1, tab2, tab3 should be used from the
model.<br />
Note, a fileName can be defined as URI by using the helper function
<a href="Modelica.Utilities.Files.loadResource.html">loadResource</a>.</li>
<li>Statically stored in function "usertab" in file "usertab.c".
The matrix is identified by "tableName". Parameter fileName =
"NoName" or has only blanks. Row-wise storage is always to be
preferred as otherwise the table is reallocated and transposed. See
the <a href="Modelica.Blocks.Tables.html">Tables</a> package
documentation for more details.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the constant "NO_FILE_SYSTEM" is defined, all file I/O
related parts of the source code are removed by the C-preprocessor,
such that no access to files takes place.</p>
<p>If tables are read from an ASCII-file, the file needs to have
the following structure ("-----" is not part of the file
content):</p>
<pre>
-----------------------------------------------------
#1
double tab1(5,2)   # comment line
  0   0
  1   1
  2   4
  3   9
  4  16
double tab2(5,2)   # another comment line
  0   0
  2   2
  4   8
  6  18
  8  32
-----------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>Note, that the first two characters in the file need to be "#1"
(a line comment defining the version number of the file format).
Afterwards, the corresponding matrix has to be declared with type
(= "double" or "float"), name and actual dimensions. Finally, in
successive rows of the file, the elements of the matrix have to be
given. The elements have to be provided as a sequence of numbers in
row-wise order (therefore a matrix row can span several lines in
the file and need not start at the beginning of a line). Numbers
have to be given according to C syntax (such as 2.3, -2, +2.e4).
Number separators are spaces, tab ( ), comma (,), or semicolon (;).
Several matrices may be defined one after another. Line comments
start with the hash symbol (#) and can appear everywhere. Other
characters, like trailing non comments, are not allowed in the
file.</p>
