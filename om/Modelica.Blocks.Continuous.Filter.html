<p>This blocks models various types of filters:</p>
<blockquote><b>low pass, high pass, band pass, and band stop
filters</b></blockquote>
<p>using various filter characteristics:</p>
<blockquote><b>CriticalDamping, Bessel, Butterworth, Chebyshev Type
I filters</b></blockquote>
<p>By default, a filter block is initialized in
<b>steady-state</b>, in order to avoid unwanted oscillations at the
beginning. In special cases, it might be useful to select one of
the other initialization options under tab "Advanced".</p>
<p>Typical frequency responses for the 4 supported low pass filter
types are shown in the next figure:</p>
<blockquote><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Blocks/LowPassOrder4Filters.png" alt="LowPassOrder4Filters.png" /></blockquote>
<p>The step responses of the same low pass filters are shown in the
next figure, starting from a steady state initial filter with
initial input = 0.2:</p>
<blockquote><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Blocks/LowPassOrder4FiltersStepResponse.png" alt="LowPassOrder4FiltersStepResponse.png" /></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, the frequency responses give a somewhat wrong
impression of the filter characteristics: Although Butterworth and
Chebyshev filters have a significantly steeper magnitude as the
CriticalDamping and Bessel filters, the step responses of the
latter ones are much better. This means for example, that a
CriticalDamping or a Bessel filter should be selected, if a filter
is mainly used to make a non-linear inverse model realizable.</p>
<p>Typical frequency responses for the 4 supported high pass filter
types are shown in the next figure:</p>
<blockquote><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Blocks/HighPassOrder4Filters.png" alt="HighPassOrder4Filters.png" /></blockquote>
<p>The corresponding step responses of these high pass filters are
shown in the next figure:</p>
<blockquote><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Blocks/HighPassOrder4FiltersStepResponse.png" alt="HighPassOrder4FiltersStepResponse.png" /></blockquote>
<p>All filters are available in <b>normalized</b> (default) and
non-normalized form. In the normalized form, the amplitude of the
filter transfer function at the cut-off frequency f_cut is -3 dB (=
10^(-3/20) = 0.70794..). Note, when comparing the filters of this
function with other software systems, the setting of "normalized"
has to be selected appropriately. For example, the signal
processing toolbox of Matlab provides the filters in non-normalized
form and therefore a comparison makes only sense, if normalized =
<b>false</b> is set. A normalized filter is usually better suited
for applications, since filters of different orders are
"comparable", whereas non-normalized filters usually require to
adapt the cut-off frequency, when the order of the filter is
changed. See a comparison of "normalized" and "non-normalized"
filters at hand of CriticalDamping filters of order 1,2,3:</p>

<blockquote><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Blocks/CriticalDampingNonNormalized.png" alt="CriticalDampingNonNormalized.png" /></blockquote>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>The filters are implemented in the following, reliable way:</p>
<ol>
<li>A prototype low pass filter with a cut-off angular frequency of
1 rad/s is constructed from the desired analogFilter and the
desired normalization.</li>
<li>This prototype low pass filter is transformed to the desired
filterType and the desired cut-off frequency f_cut using a
transformation on the Laplace variable "s".</li>
<li>The resulting first and second order transfer functions are
implemented in state space form, using the "eigen value"
representation of a transfer function:
<pre>

  // second order block with eigen values: a +/- jb
  <b>der</b>(x1) = a*x1 - b*x2 + (a^2 + b^2)/b*u;
  <b>der</b>(x2) = b*x1 + a*x2;
       y  = x2;
     
</pre>
The dc-gain from the input to the output of this block is one and
the selected states are in the order of the input (if "u" is in the
order of "one", then the states are also in the order of "one"). In
the "Advanced" tab, a "nominal" value for the input "u" can be
given. If appropriately selected, the states are in the order of
"one" and then step-size control is always appropriate.</li>
