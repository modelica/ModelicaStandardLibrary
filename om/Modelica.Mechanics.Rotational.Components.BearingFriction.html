<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This element describes <b>Coulomb friction</b> in
<b>bearings</b>, i.e., a frictional torque acting between a flange
and the housing. The positive sliding friction torque "tau" has to
be defined by table "tau_pos" as function of the absolute angular
velocity "w". E.g.</p>
<pre>
       w | tau
      ---+-----
       0 |   0
       1 |   2
       2 |   5
       3 |   8
</pre>
<p>gives the following table:</p>
<pre>
   tau_pos = [0, 0; 1, 2; 2, 5; 3, 8];
</pre>
<p>Currently, only linear interpolation in the table is supported.
Outside of the table, extrapolation through the last two table
entries is used. It is assumed that the negative sliding friction
force has the same characteristic with negative values. Friction is
modelled in the following way:</p>
<p>When the absolute angular velocity "w" is not zero, the friction
torque is a function of w and of a constant normal force. This
dependency is defined via table tau_pos and can be determined by
measurements, e.g., by driving the gear with constant velocity and
measuring the needed motor torque (= friction torque).</p>
<p>When the absolute angular velocity becomes zero, the elements
connected by the friction element become stuck, i.e., the absolute
angle remains constant. In this phase the friction torque is
calculated from a torque balance due to the requirement, that the
absolute acceleration shall be zero. The elements begin to slide
when the friction torque exceeds a threshold value, called the
maximum static friction torque, computed via:</p>
<pre>
   maximum_static_friction = <b>peak</b> * sliding_friction(w=0)  (<b>peak</b> &gt;= 1)
</pre>
<p>This procedure is implemented in a "clean" way by state events
and leads to continuous/discrete systems of equations if friction
elements are dynamically coupled which have to be solved by
appropriate numerical methods. The method is described in:</p>

<dd><b>Hybrid Modeling in Modelica based on the Synchronous Data
Flow Principle</b>. CACSD'99, Aug. 22.-26, Hawaii.</dd>
</dl>
<p>More precise friction models take into account the elasticity of
the material when the two elements are "stuck", as well as other
effects, like hysteresis. This has the advantage that the friction
element can be completely described by a differential equation
without events. The drawback is that the system becomes stiff
(about 10-20 times slower simulation) and that more material
constants have to be supplied which requires more sophisticated
identification. For more details, see the following references,
