<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Below the major design decisions of this library are
summarized.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>C-Function Interface</b><br />
This library contains several interfaces to C-functions in order to
operate with the environment. As will become clear, it is usually
required that a Modelica tool vendor provides an implementation of
these C-functions that are suited for his environment. In directory
"Modelica/Resources/C-Sources" a reference implementation is given
for Microsoft Windows Systems and for POSIX environments. The files
"ModelicaInternal.c" and "ModelicaStrings.c" can be used as a basis
for the integration in the vendors environment.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Character Encoding</b><br />
The representation of characters is different in operating systems.
The more modern ones (e.g., Windows-NT) use an early variant of
Unicode (16 bit per character) other (e.g., Windows-ME) use 8-bit
encoding. Also 32 bit per character and multi-byte representations
are in use. This is important, since e.g., Japanese Modelica users
need Unicode representation. The design in this library is done in
such a way that a basic set of calls to the operating system hides
the actual character representation. This means, that all functions
of this package can be used independent from the underlying
character representation.<br />
The C-interface of the Modelica language provides only an 8-bit
character encoding passing mechanism of strings. As a result, the
reference implementation in "Modelica.Utilities\C-Source" needs to
be adapted to the character representation supported in the
Modelica vendor environment.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Internal String Representation</b><br />
The design of this package was made in order that string handling
is convenient. This is in contrast to, e.g., the C-language, where
string handling is inconvenient, cumbersome and error prone, but on
the other hand is in some sense "efficient". The standard reference
implementation in "Modelica.Utilities\C-Source" is based on the
standard C definition of a string, i.e., a pointer to a sequence of
characters, ended with a null terminating character. In order that
the string handling in this package is convenient, some assumptions
have been made, especially, that the access to a substring is
efficient (O(1) access instead of O(n) as in standard C). This
allows to hide string pointer arithmetic from the user. In such a
case, a similar efficiency as in C can be expected for most high
level operations, such as find, sort, replace. The "efficient
character access" can be reached if, e.g., the number of characters
are stored in a string, and the length of a character is fixed, say
16 or 32 bit (if all Unicode characters shall be represented). A
vendor should adapt the reference implementation in this
respect.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>String copy = pointer copy</b><br />
The Modelica language has no mechanism to change a character of a
string. When a string has to be modified, the only way to achieve
this is to generate it newly. The advantage is that a Modelica tool
can treat a string as a constant entity and can replace (expensive)
string copy operations by pointer copy operations. For example,
when sorting a set of strings the following type of operations
occur:
<pre>
     String s[:], s_temp;
      ...
     s_temp := s[i];
     s[i]   := s[j];
     s[j]   := s_temp;
     
</pre>
Formally, three strings are copied. Due to the feature sketched
above, a Modelica tool can replace this copy operation by pointer
assignments, a very "cheap" operation. The Modelica.Utilities
functions will perform efficiently, if such types of optimizations
are supported by the tool.</li>
