<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>The Modelica.Fluid library provides basic interfaces and
components to model 1-dimensional thermo-fluid flow in networks of
pipes. It is not the intention that this library covers all
application cases because the fluid flow area is too large and
because for special applications it is possible to implement
libraries with simpler component interfaces. Instead, the goal is
that the Modelica.Fluid library provides a <b>reasonable set of
components</b> and that it <b>demonstrates</b> how to implement
components of a fluid flow library in Modelica, in particular to
cope with difficult issues such as connector design, reversing flow
and initialization. It is planned to include more components in the
future. User proposals are welcome.</p>
<p>This library has the following main features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The connectors Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort_a/_b are
designed for one-dimensional flow of a <b>single substance</b> or
of a <b>mixture of substances</b> with optional <b>multiple
phases</b>. All media models from Modelica.Media can be utilized
when connecting components. For one substance media, the additional
arrays for multiple substance media have zero dimension and are
therefore removed from the code during translation. The general
connector definition therefore does not introduce an overhead for
special cases.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>All the components of the Modelica.Fluid library are designed
that they can be utilized for all media models from Modelica.Media
if this is possible. For example, all media can be utilized for the
Modelica.Fluid.Sensors/Sources components. For some components only
special media are possible, since additional functionality is
required. For example, Modelica.Fluid.Components.Evaporator
requires a two phase medium (extending from
Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialTwoPhaseMedium).<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>In order to simplify the initialization in the components,
there is the restriction that only media models are supported that
have T, (p,T), (p,h), (T,X), (p,T,X) or (p,h,X) as independent
variables. Other media models would be possible, e.g., with (T,d)
as independent variables. However, this requires to rewrite the
code for the component initialization. (Note, T is temperature, p
is pressure, d is density, h is specific enthalpy, and X is a mass
fraction vector).<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>All components work for <b>incompressible</b> and
<b>compressible</b> media. This is implemented by a small change in
the initialization of a component, if the medium is incompressible.
Otherwise, the equations of the components are not influenced by
this property.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>All components allow fluid flow in both directions, i.e.,
<b>reversing flow</b> is supported. However, it is possible to
declare that the flow through a component only has the design
direction, in order to obtain faster simulation code.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Two or more components can be connected together. This means
that the pressures of all connected ports are equal and the mass
flow rates sum up to zero. Specific enthalpy, mass fractions and
trace substances are mixed according to the mass flow rates.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>The <b>momentum balance</b> and the <b>energy balance</b> are
only fulfilled exactly if <b>two ports of equal diameter</b> are
connected. In all other cases, the balances are approximated,
because kinetic and friction effect are neglected. An explicit
fitting or junction should be used if these are important for the
specific problem at hand. In all circuits where friction dominates,
or components such as pumps determine the flow rate, kinetic
pressure is typically irrelevant. You can consider the <a href="Modelica.Fluid.Examples.Explanatory.MomentumBalanceFittings.html">
Modelica.Fluid.Examples.Explanatory.MomentumBalanceFittings</a>
model (and its documentation) to see one case where the momentum
balance essentially depends on kinetic pressure, so it is necessary
to use explicit fittings in order to obtain correct results.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Given the above-mentioned limitations, there is no restriction
how components can be connected together. The resulting simulation
performance however often strongly depends on the model structure
and modeling assumptions made. In particular the direct connection
of fluid volumes generally results in high-index DAEs for the
pressures. The direct connection of flow models generally results
in systems of implicit nonlinear algebraic equations.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
