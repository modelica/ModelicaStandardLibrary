<p>In this section, an overview of the most important features of
this library is given.</p>
<h4>Steps and Transitions</h4>
<p>A <b>StateGraph</b> is an enhanced finite state machine. It is
based on the JGrafchart method and takes advantage of Modelica
features for the "action" language. JGrafchart is a further
development of Grafcet to include elements of StateCharts that are
not present in Grafcet/Sequential Function Charts. Therefore, the
StateGraph library has a similar modeling power as StateCharts but
avoids some deficiencies of StateCharts.</p>
<p>The basic elements of StateGraphs are <b>steps</b> and
<b>transitions</b>:</p>
<p><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/StateGraph/UsersGuide/StepAndTransition1.png" /></p>
<p><b>Steps</b> represent the possible states a StateGraph can
have. If a step is active the Boolean variable <b>active</b> of the
step is <b>true</b>. If it is deactivated, <b>active</b> =
<b>false</b>. At the initial time, all "usual" steps are
deactivated. The <b>InitialStep</b> objects are steps that are
activated at the initial time. They are characterized by a double
box (see figure above).</p>
<p><b>Transitions</b> are used to change the state of a StateGraph.
When the step connected to the input of a transition is active, the
step connected to the output of this transition is deactivated and
the transition condition becomes true, then the transition fires.
This means that the step connected to the input to the transition
is deactivated and the step connected to the output of the
transition is activated.</p>
<p>The transition <b>condition</b> is defined via the parameter
menu of the transition object. Clicking on object "transition1" in
the above figure, results in the following menu:</p>
<p><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/StateGraph/UsersGuide/StepAndTransition2.png" /></p>
<p>In the input field "<b>condition</b>", any type of time varying
Boolean expression can be given (in Modelica notation, this is a
modification of the time varying variable <b>condition</b>).
Whenever this condition is true, the transition can fire.
Additionally, it is possible to activate a timer, via
<b>enableTimer</b> (see menu above) and provide a <b>waitTime</b>.
In this case the firing of the transition is delayed according to
the provided waitTime. The transition condition and the waitTime
are displayed in the transition icon.</p>
<p>In the above example, the simulation starts at
<b>initialStep</b>. After 1 second, <b>transition1</b> fires and
<b>step1</b> becomes active. After another second
<b>transition2</b> fires and <b>initialStep</b> becomes again
active. After a further second <b>step1</b> becomes again active,
and so on.</p>
<p>In JGrafcharts, Grafcet and Sequential Function Charts, the
network of steps and transitions is drawn from top to bottom. In
StateGraphs, no particular direction is defined, since steps and
transitions are blocks with input and output connectors that can be
arbitrarily placed and connected. Usually, it is most practical to
define the network from left to right, as in the example above,
since then it is easy to read the labels on the icons.</p>
<h4>Conditions and Actions</h4>
<p>With the block <b>TransitionWithSignal</b>, the firing condition
can be provided as Boolean input signal, instead as entry in the
menu of the transition. An example is given in the next figure:</p>
<p><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/StateGraph/UsersGuide/StepAndTransition3.png" /></p>
<p>Component "step" is an instance of "StepWithSignal" that is a
usual step where the active flag is available as Boolean output
signal. To this output, component "Timer" from library
"Modelica.Blocks.Logical" is connected. It measures the time from
the time instant where the Boolean input (i.e., the active flag of
the step) became true up to the current time instant. The timer is
connected to a comparison component. The output is true, once the
timer reaches 1 second. This signal is used as condition input of
the transition. As a result, "transition2" fires, once step "step"
has been active for 1 second. Of course, any other Modelica block
with a Boolean output signal can be connected to the condition
input of such a transition block as well.</p>
<p>Conditions of a transition can either be computed by a network
of logical blocks from the Logical library as in the figure above,
or via the "SetBoolean" component any type of logical expression
can be defined in textual form, as shown in the next figure:</p>
<p><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/StateGraph/UsersGuide/StepAndTransition4.png" /></p>
<p>With the block "<b>SetBoolean</b>", a time varying expression
can be provided as modification to the output signal <b>y</b> (see
block with icon text "timer.y &gt; 1" in the figure above). The
output signal can be in turn connected to the condition input of a
TransitionWithSignal block.</p>
<p>The "<b>SetBoolean</b>" block can also be used to compute a
Boolean signal depending on the active step. In the figure above,
the output of the block with the icon text "step.active" is true,
when "step" is active, otherwise it is false (note, the icon text
of "SetBoolean" displays the modification of the output signal
"y"). This signal can then be used to compute desired
<b>actions</b> in the physical systems model. For example, if a
<b>valve</b> shall be open, when the StateGraph is in "step1" or in
"step4", a "SetBoolean" block may be connected to the valve model
using the following condition:</p>
<pre>
    valve = step1.active <b>or</b> step2.active
</pre>
<p>Via the Modelica operators <b>edge</b>(..) and
<b>change</b>(..), conditions depending on rising and falling edges
of Boolean expressions can be used when needed.</p>
<p>In JGrafcharts, Grafcet, Sequential Function Charts and
StateCharts, <b>actions</b> are formulated <b>within a step</b>.
Such actions are distinguished as <b>entry</b>, <b>normal</b>,
<b>exit</b> and <b>abort</b> actions. For example, a valve might be
opened by an entry action of a step and might be closed by an exit
action of the same step. In StateGraphs, this is (fortunately)
<b>not possible</b> due to Modelica's "single assignment rule" that
requires that every variable is defined by exactly one equation.
Instead, the approach explained above is used. For example, via the
"SetBoolean" component, the valve variable is set to true when the
StateGraph is in particular steps.</p>
<p>This feature of a StateGraph is <b>very useful</b>, since it
allows a Modelica translator to <b>guarantee</b> that a given
StateGraph has always <b>deterministic</b> behaviour without
conflicts. In the other methodologies this is much more cumbersome.
For example, if two steps are executed in parallel and both step
actions modify the same variable, the result is either
non-deterministic or non-obvious rules have to be defined which
action takes priority. In a StateGraph, such a situation is
detected by the translator resulting in an error, since there are
two equations to compute one variable. Additional benefits of the
StateGraph approach are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A JGrafchart or a StateChart need to potentially access
variables in a step that are defined in higher hierarchical levels
of a model. Therefore, mostly <b>global variables</b> are used in
the whole network, even if the network is structured
hierarchically. In StateGraphs this is not necessary, since the
physical systems outside of a StateGraph might access the step or
transition state via a hierarchical name. This means that <b>no
global variables</b> are needed, because the local variables in the
StateGraph are accessed from local variables outside of the
StateGraph.</li>
<li>It is simpler for a user to understand the information that is
provided in the non-graphical definition, since every variable is
defined at exactly one place. In the other methodologies, the
setting and re-setting of the same variable is cluttered within the
whole network.</li>
</ul>
<p>To emphasize this important difference between these
methodologies, consider the case that a state machine has the
following hierarchy:</p>
<pre>
   stateMachine.superstate1.superstate2.step1
</pre>
<p>Within "step1" a StateChart would, e.g., access variable
"stateMachine.openValve", say as "entry action: openValve = true".
This typical usage has the severe drawback that it is not possible
to use the hierarchical state "superstate1" as component in another
context, because "step1" references a particular name outside of
this component.</p>
<p>In a StateGraph, there would be typically a "SetBoolean"
component in the "stateMachine" component stating:</p>
<pre>
    openValve = superstate1.superstate2.step1.active;
</pre>
<p>As a result, the "superstate1" component can be used in another
context, because it does not depend on the environment where it is
used.</p>
<h4>Execution Model</h4>
<p>The execution model of a StateGraph follows from its Modelica
implementation: Given the states of all steps, i.e., whether a step
is active or not active, the equations of all steps, transitions,
transition conditions, actions etc. are sorted resulting in an
execution sequence to compute essentially the new values of the
steps. If conflicts occur, e.g., if there are more equations as
variables, of if there are algebraic loops between Boolean
variables, an exception is raised. Once all equations have been
processed, the <b>active</b> variable of all steps are updated to
the newly calculated values. Afterwards, the equations are again
evaluated. The iteration stops, once no step changes its state
anymore, i.e., once no transition fires anymore. Then, simulation
continuous until a new event is triggered, (when a relation changes
its value).</p>
<p>With the Modelica "sampled(..)" operator, a StateGraph might
also be executed within a discrete controller that is called at
regular time instants. In a future version of the StateGraph
library, this might be more directly supported.</p>
<h4>Parallel and Alternative Execution</h4>
<p>Parallel activities can be defined by component <b>Parallel</b>
and alternative activities can be defined by component
<b>Alternative</b>. An example for both components is given in the
next figure.</p>
<p><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/StateGraph/UsersGuide/Parallel1.png" /></p>
<p>Here, the branch from "step2" to "step5" is executed in parallel
to "step1". A transition connected to the output of a parallel
branch component can only fire if the final steps in all parallel
branches are active simultaneously. The figure above is a
screen-shot from the animation of the StateGraph: Whenever a step
is active or a transition can fire, the corresponding component is
marked in <b>green</b> color.</p>
<p>The three branches within "step2" to "step5" are executed
alternatively, depending which transition condition of
"transition3", "transition4", "transition4a" fires first. Since all
three transitions fire after 1 second, they are all candidates for
the active branch. If two or more transitions would fire at the
same time instant, a priority selection is made: The alternative
and parallel components have a vector of connectors. Every branch
has to be connected to exactly one entry of the connector vector.
The entry with the lowest number has the highest priority.</p>
<p>Parallel, Alternative and Step components have vectors of
connectors. The dimensions of these vectors are set in the
corresponding parameter menu. E.g. in a "Parallel" component:</p>
<p><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/StateGraph/UsersGuide/Parallel2.png" /></p>
<p>Currently in Dymola the following menu pops up, when a branch is
connected to a vector of components in order to define the vector
index to which the component shall be connected:</p>
<p><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/StateGraph/UsersGuide/Parallel3.png" /></p>
<h4>CompositeSteps, Suspend and Resume Port</h4>
<p>A StateGraph can be hierarchically structured by using a
<b>CompositeStep</b>. This is a component that inherits from
<b>PartialCompositeStep</b>. An example is given in the next figure
(from Examples.ControlledTanks):</p>
<p><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/StateGraph/UsersGuide/CompositeStep1.png" /></p>
<p>The CompositeStep component contains a local StateGraph that is
entered by one or more input transitions and that is left by one or
more output transitions. Also, other needed signals may enter a
CompositeStep. The CompositeStep has similar properties as a
"usual" step: The CompositeStep is <b>active</b> once at least one
step within the CompositeStep is active. Variable <b>active</b>
defines the state of the CompositeStep.</p>
<p>Additionally, a CompositeStep has a <b>suspend</b> port.
Whenever the transition connected to this port fires, the
CompositeStep is left at once. When leaving the CompositeStep via
the suspend port, the internal state of the CompositeStep is saved,
i.e., the active flags of all steps within the CompositeStep. The
CompositeStep might be entered via its <b>resume</b> port. In this
case the internal state from the suspend transition is
reconstructed and the CompositeStep continues the execution that it
had before the suspend transition fired (this corresponds to the
history ports of StateCharts or JGrafcharts).</p>
<p>A CompositeStep may contain other CompositeSteps. At every
level, a CompositeStep and all of its content can be left via its
suspend ports (actually, there is a vector of suspend connectors,
i.e., a CompositeStep might be aborted due to different
transitions).</p>
