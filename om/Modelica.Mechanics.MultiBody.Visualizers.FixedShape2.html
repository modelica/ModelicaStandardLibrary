<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Model <b>FixedShape2</b> defines a visual shape that is shown at
the location of its frame_a. This model is identical to
<b>FixedShape</b> with the only difference that an additional
frame_b is present which is parallel to frame_a. This makes it more
convenient to connect several visual shapes together when building
up more complex visual objects. All describing data such as size
and color can vary dynamically by providing appropriate expressions
in the input fields of the parameter menu. The only exception is
parameter shapeType that cannot be changed during simulation. The
following shapes are currently supported via parameter
<b>shapeType</b> (e.g., shapeType="box"):<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
The dark blue arrows in the figure above are directed along
variable <b>lengthDirection</b>. The light blue arrows are directed
along variable <b>widthDirection</b>. The <b>coordinate systems</b>
in the figure represent frame_a of the FixedShape component.</p>
<p>Additionally, <b>external shapes</b> can be specified as (not
all options might be supported by all tools):</p>
<ul>
<li><b>"1", "2", ...</b><br />
define external shapes specified in DXF format in files "1.dxf",
"2.dxf", ... The DXF-files must be found either in the current
directory or in the directory where the Shape instance is stored
that references the DXF file. This (very limited) option should not
be used for new models. Example:<br />
shapeType="1".<br /></li>
<li>
"<b>modelica:</b>//&lt;Modelica-name&gt;/&lt;relative-path-file-name&gt;"<br />

characterizes the file that is stored under the location of the
&lt;Modelica-name&gt; library path with the given relative file
name. Example:<br />
shapeType =
"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Data/Shapes/Engine/piston.dxf".<br />
</li>
<li>"<b>file:</b>//&lt;absolute-file-name&gt;"<br />
characterizes an absolute file name in the file system.
Example:<br />
shapeType="file://C:/users/myname/shapes/piston.dxf".</li>
</ul>
<p>The supported file formats are tool dependent. Most tools
support at least DXF-files (a tool might support 3-dim. Face of the
DXF format only), but may support other format as well (such as
stl, obj, 3ds). Since visualization files contain color and other
data, the corresponding information in the model is usually
ignored.</p>
<p>The sizes of any of the above components are specified by the
<b>length</b>, <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> variables. Via
variable <b>extra</b> additional data can be defined:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr>
<th><b>shapeType</b></th>
<th>Meaning of parameter <b>extra</b></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">"cylinder"</td>
<td valign="top">if extra &gt; 0, a black line is included in the
cylinder to show the rotation of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">"cone"</td>
<td valign="top">extra = diameter-left-side / diameter-right-side,
i.e.,<br />
extra = 1: cylinder<br />
extra = 0: "real" cone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">"pipe"</td>
<td valign="top">extra = outer-diameter / inner-diameter,
i.e,<br />
extra = 1: cylinder that is completely hollow<br />
extra = 0: cylinder without a hole.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">"gearwheel"</td>
<td valign="top">extra is the number of teeth of the (external)
gear. If extra &lt; 0, an internal gear is visualized with |extra|
teeth. The axis of the gearwheel is along "lengthDirection", and
usually: width = height = 2*radiusOfGearWheel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">"spring"</td>
<td valign="top">extra is the number of windings of the spring.
Additionally, "height" is <b>not</b> the "height" but
2*coil-width.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">external shape</td>
<td valign="top">extra = 0: Visualization from file is not
scaled.<br />
extra = 1: Visualization from file is scaled with "length", "width"
and height" of the shape</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Parameter <b>color</b> is a vector with 3 elements, {r, g, b},
and specifies the color of the shape. {r,g,b} are the "red",
"green" and "blue" color parts. Note, r g, b are given as
Integer[3] in the ranges 0 .. 255, respectively. The predefined
type <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Types.Color.html">MultiBody.Types.Color</a>
contains a menu definition of the colors used in the MultiBody
library together with a color editor.</p>
<p>In the following figure the relationships between frame_a and
frame_b are shown. The origin of frame_b with respect to frame_a is
specified via parameter vector <b>r</b>.</p>
