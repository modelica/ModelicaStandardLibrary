<p>This is a model of the mechanical part of one cylinder of an
engine. The combustion is not modelled. The "inertia" component at
the lower left part is the output inertia of the engine driving the
gearbox. The angular velocity of the output inertia has a start
value of 10 rad/s in order to demonstrate the movement of the
engine.</p>
<p>The engine is modeled solely by revolute and prismatic joints.
Since this results in a <b>planar</b> loop there is the well known
difficulty that the cut-forces perpendicular to the loop cannot be
uniquely computed, as well as the cut-torques within the plane.
This ambiguity is resolved by using the option
<b>planarCutJoint</b> in the <b>Advanced</b> menu of one revolute
joint in every planar loop (here: joint B1). This option sets the
cut-force in direction of the axis of rotation, as well as the
cut-torques perpendicular to the axis of rotation at this joint to
zero and makes the problem mathematically well-formed.</p>
<p>An animation of this example is shown in the figure below.</p>
