<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Without pre-caution when implementing a medium model, it is very
easy that non-linear algebraic systems of equations occur when
using the medium model. In this section it is explained how to
avoid non-linear systems of equations that result from unnecessary
dynamic state selections.</p>
<p>A medium model should be implemented in such a way that a tool
is able to select states of a medium in a balance volume statically
(during translation). This is only possible if the medium equations
are written in a specific way. Otherwise, a tool has to dynamically
select states during simulation. Since medium equations are usually
non-linear, this means that non-linear algebraic systems of
equations would occur in every balance volume.</p>
<p>It is assumed that medium equations in a balance volume are
defined in the following way:</p>
<pre>
    <b>package</b> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
    Medium.BaseProperties medium;
  <b>equation</b>
     // mass balance
       <b>der</b>(M)  = port_a.m_flow + port_b.m_flow;
       <b>der</b>(MX) = port_a_mX_flow + port_b_mX_flow;
             M = V*medium.d;
            MX = M*medium.X;

     // Energy balance
     U = M*medium.u;
     <b>der</b>(U) = port_a.H_flow+port_b.H_flow;
</pre>
<p><b>Single Substance Media</b></p>
<p>A medium consisting of a single substance has to define two of
"p,T,d,u,h" with stateSelect=StateSelect.prefer if
BaseProperties.preferredMediumstates = <b>true</b> and has to
provide the other three variables as function of these states. This
results in:</p>
<ul>
<li>static state selection (no dynamic choices).</li>
<li>a linear system of equations in the two state derivatives.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Example for a single substance medium</b></p>
<p>p, T are preferred states (i.e., StateSelect.prefer is set) and
there are three equations written in the form:</p>
<pre>
   d = fd(p,T)
   u = fu(p,T)
   h = fh(p,T)
</pre>
<p>Index reduction leads to the equations:</p>
<pre>
   <b>der</b>(M) = V*<b>der</b>(d)
   <b>der</b>(U) = <b>der</b>(M)*u + M*<b>der</b>(u)
   <b>der</b>(d) = <b>der</b>(fd,p)*<b>der</b>(p) + <b>der</b>(fd,T)*<b>der</b>(T)
   <b>der</b>(u) = <b>der</b>(fu,p)*<b>der</b>(p) + <b>der</b>(fu,T)*<b>der</b>(T)
</pre>
<p>Note, that <b>der</b>(y,x) is the partial derivative of y with
respect to x and that this operator will be introduced in a future
version of the Modelica language. The above equations imply, that
if p,T are provided from the integrator as states, all functions,
such as fd(p,T) or <b>der</b>(fd,p) can be evaluated as function of
the states. The overall system results in a linear system of
equations in <b>der</b>(p) and <b>der</b>(T) after eliminating
<b>der</b>(M), <b>der</b>(U), <b>der</b>(d), <b>der</b>(u) via
tearing.</p>
<p><b>Counter Example for a single substance medium</b></p>
<p>An ideal gas with one substance is written in the form</p>
<pre>
  <b>redeclare model extends</b> BaseProperties(
     T(stateSelect=if preferredMediumStates then StateSelect.prefer else StateSelect.default),
     p(stateSelect=if preferredMediumStates then StateSelect.prefer else StateSelect.default)
  <b>equation</b>
     h = h(T);
     u = h - R*T;
     p = d*R*T;
      ...
  <b>end</b> BaseProperties;
</pre>
<p>If p, T are preferred states, these equations are <b>not</b>
written in the recommended form, because d is not a function of p
and T. If p,T would be states, it would be necessary to solve for
the density:</p>
<pre>
   d = p/(R*T)
</pre>
<p>If T or R are zero, this results in a division by zero. A tool
does not know that R or T cannot become zero. Therefore, a tool
must assume that p, T <b>cannot</b> always be selected as states
and has to either use another static state selection or use dynamic
state selection. The only other choice for static state selection
is d,T, because h,u,p are given as functions of d,T. However, as
potential states only variables appearing differentiated and
variables declared with StateSelect.prefer or StateSelect.always
are used. Since "d" does not appear differentiated and has
StateSelect.default, it cannot be selected as a state. As a result,
the tool has to select states dynamically during simulation. Since
the equations above are non-linear and they are utilized in the
dynamic state selection, a non-linear system of equations is
present in every balance volume.</p>
<p>To summarize, for single substance ideal gas media there are the
following two possibilities to get static state selection and
linear systems of equations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use p,T as preferred states and write the equation for d in the
form: d = p/(T*R)</li>
<li>Use d,T as preferred states and write the equation for p in the
form: p = d*T*R</li>
</ol>
<p>All other settings (other/no preferred states etc.) lead to
dynamic state selection and non-linear systems of equations for a
balance volume.</p>
<p><b>Multiple Substance Media</b></p>
<p>A medium consisting of multiple substance has to define two of
"p,T,d,u,h" as well as the mass fractions Xi with
stateSelect=StateSelect.prefer (if
BaseProperties.preferredMediumStates = <b>true</b>) and has to
provide the other three variables as functions of these states.
Only then, static selection is possible for a tool.</p>
<p><b>Example for a multiple substance medium:</b></p>
<p>p, T and Xi are defined as preferred states and the equations
are written in the form:</p>
<pre>
   d = fp(p,T,Xi);
   u = fu(p,T,Xi);
   h = fh(p,T,Xi);
</pre>
<p>Since the balance equations are written in the form:</p>
<pre>
              M = V*medium.d;
            MXi = M*medium.Xi;
</pre>
<p>The variables M and MXi appearing differentiated in the balance
equations are provided as functions of d and Xi and since d is
given as a function of p, T and Xi, it is possible to compute M and
MXi directly from the desired states. This means that static state
selection is possible.</p>
