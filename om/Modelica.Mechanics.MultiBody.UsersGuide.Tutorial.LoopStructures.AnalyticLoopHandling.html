<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>It is well known that the non-linear algebraic equations of most
mechanical loops in technical devices can be solved analytically.
It is, however, difficult to perform this fully automatically and
therefore none of the commercial, general purpose multi-body
programs, such as MSC ADAMS, LMS DADS, SIMPACK, have this feature.
These programs solve loop structures with pure numerical methods.
Multi-body programs that are designed for real-time simulation of
the dynamics of specific vehicles, such as ve-DYNA, usually contain
manual implementations of a particular multi-body system (the
vehicle) where the occurring loops are either analytically solved,
if this is possible, or are treated by table look-up where the
tables are constructed in a pre-processing phase. Without these
features the required real-time capability would be difficult to
achieve.</p>
<p>In a series of papers and dissertations Prof. Hiller and his
group in Duisburg, Germany, have developed systematic methods to
handle mechanical loops analytically. The "characteristic pair of
joints" method basically cuts a loop at two joints and uses
geometric invariants to reduce the number of algebraic equations,
often down to one equation that can be solved analytically. Also
several multi-body codes have been developed that are based on this
method, e.g., MOBILE. Besides the very desired feature to solve
non-linear algebraic equations analytically, i.e., efficiently and
in a robust way, there are several drawbacks: It is difficult to
apply this method automatically. Even if this would be possible in
a good way, there is always the problem that it cannot be
guaranteed that the statically selected states lead to no
singularity during simulation. Therefore, the "characteristic pair
of joints" method is usually manually applied which requires
know-how and experience.</p>
<p>In the MultiBody library the "characteristic pair of joints"
method is supported in a restricted form such that it can be
applied also by non-specialists. The idea is to provide
aggregations of joints in package <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Joints.Assemblies.html">MultiBody.Joints.Assemblies</a>.
as one object that either have <b>6</b> degrees of freedom or
<b>3</b> degrees of freedom (for usage in planar loops).</p>
<p>As an example, a variant of the four bar mechanism is given in
the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/Tutorial/LoopStructures/FourbarAnalytic1.png" /></p>
<p>Here, the mechanism is modeled with one revolute joint, two
spherical joints and one prismatic joint. In the figure below, the
two spherical joints and the prismatic joint are collected together
in an assembly object called "jointSSP" from <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Joints.Assemblies.JointSSP.html">
MultiBody.Joints.Assemblies.JointSSP</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/Tutorial/LoopStructures/FourbarAnalytic2.png" /></p>
<p>The JointSSP joint aggregation has a frame at the left side of
the left spherical joint (frame_a) and a frame at the right side of
the prismatic joint (frame_b). JointSSP, as all other objects from
the Joints.Assemblies package, has the property, that the
<b>generalized coordinates, and all other frames defined in the
assembly, can be calculated given the movement of frame_a and of
frame_b</b>. This is performed by <b>analytically</b> solving
non-linear systems of equations (details are given in section xxx).
From a structural point of view, the equations in an assembly
object are written in the form</p>
<p align="left"><b>q</b> =
<b>f</b><sub>1</sub>(<b>r</b><sup>a</sup>, <b>R</b><sup>a</sup>,
<b>r</b><sup>b</sup>, <b>R</b><sup>b</sup>)</p>
<p>where <b>r</b><sup>a</sup>,
<b>R</b><sup>a</sup>,<b>r</b><sup>b</sup>, <b>R</b><sup>b</sup> are
the variables defining the position and orientation of the frame_a
and frame_b connector, <b>q</b> are the generalized positional
coordinates inside the assembly, e.g., the angle of a revolute
joint. Given angle <span style="font-family:Symbol">j</span> of
revolute joint j1 from the four bar mechanism, frame_a and frame_b
of the assembly object can be computed by a forward recursion</p>
<p align="left">(<b>r</b><sup>a</sup>, <b>R</b><sup>a</sup>,
<b>r</b><sup>b</sup>, <b>R</b><sup>b</sup>) = <b>f</b>(<span style="font-family:Symbol">j)</span></p>
<p>Since this is a structural property, the symbolic algorithms can
automatically select <span style="font-family:Symbol">j</span> and
its derivative as states and then all positional variables can be
computed in a forwards sequence. It is now understandable that a
Modelica translator, such as Dymola, can transform the equations of
the four bar mechanism to a recursive sequence of statements that
has no non-linear algebraic loops anymore(remember, the previous
"straightforward" solution with 6 revolute joints and 1 prismatic
joint has a nonlinear system of equations of order 5).</p>
<p>The aggregated joint objects consist of a combination of either
a revolute or prismatic joint and of a rod that has either two
spherical joints at its two ends or a spherical and a universal
joint, respectively. For all combinations, analytic solutions can
be determined. For planar loops, combinations of 1, 2 or 3 revolute
joints with parallel axes and of 2 or 1 prismatic joint with axes
that are orthogonal to the revolute joints can be treated
analytically. The currently supported combinations are listed in
the table below. The missing combinations (such as JointSUP or
Joint RPP) will be added in one of the next releases.</p>

<p>On first view this seems to be quite restrictive. However,
mechanical devices are usually built up with rods connected by
spherical joints on each end, and additionally with revolute and
prismatic joints. Therefore, the combinations of the above table
occur frequently. The universal joint is usually not present in
actual devices but is used (a) if two JointXXX components can be
connected such that a revolute and a universal joint together form
a spherical joint and (b) if the orientation of the connecting rod
between two spherical joints is needed, e.g., since a body shall be
attached. In this case one of the spherical joints might be
replaced by a universal joint. This approximation is fine as long
as the mass and inertia of the rod is not significant.</p>

suspension in the next figure is from the Modelica VehicleDynamics

<p>Let us discuss item (a) in more detail: The MacPherson
suspension in the next figure is from the Modelica VehicleDynamics
library.</p>
<p><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/Tutorial/LoopStructures/MacPherson1.png" /></p>
<p>It has three frame connectors. The lower left one (frame_C) is
fixed in the vehicle chassis. The upper left one (frame_S) is
driven by the steering mechanism, i.e., the movement of both frames
are given. The frame connector on the right (frame_U) drives the
wheel. The three frames are connected by a mechanism consisting
essentially of two rods with spherical joints on both ends. These
are built up by a jointUPS and a jointSSR assembly. As can be seen,
the universal joint from the jointUPS assembly is connected to the
revolute joint of the jointSSR assembly. Therefore, we have 3
revolute joints connected together at one point and if the axes of
rotations are chosen appropriately, this describes a spherical
joint. In other words, the two connected assemblies define the
desired two rods with spherical joints on each ends.</p>
<p>The movement of the chassis, frame_C, is computed somewhere
else. When the generalized coordinates of revolute joint
"innerJoint" (lower left part in figure) are used as states, then
frame_a and frame_b of the jointUPS joint can be calculated. After
the non-linear loop with jointUPS is (analytically) solved, all
frames on this assembly are known, especially, the one connected to
frame_b of the jointSSR assembly. Since frame_b of jointSSR is
connected to frame_S which is computed from the steering mechanism,
again the two required frame movements of the jointSSR assembly are
calculated, meaning in turn that also all other frames on the
jointSSR assembly can be computed, especially, the one connected to
frame_U that drives the wheel. From this analysis it is clear that
a tool is able to solve these coupled loops analytically.</p>
<p>Another example is the model of the V6 engine, see next figure
for an animation view and the original definition of one cylinder
with elementary joints.</p>
<p><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/Tutorial/LoopStructures/EngineV6_3.png" width="303" height="136" /> <img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/Tutorial/LoopStructures/EngineV6_2.png" />
</p>
<p>It is sufficient to rewrite the basic cylinder model by
replacing the joints with a JointRRP object that has two revolute
and one prismatic joint, see next figure.</p>
<p><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/Tutorial/LoopStructures/EngineV6_4.png" /></p>
<p>Since 6 cylinders are connected together, 6 coupled loops with 6
JointRRP objects are present. This model is available as <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Examples.Loops.EngineV6_analytic.html">
MultiBody.Examples.Loops.EngineV6_analytic</a>.</p>
<p>The composition diagram of the connected 6 cylinders is shown in
the next figure</p>
<p><img src="../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/Tutorial/LoopStructures/EngineV6_1.png" /></p>
<p>It can be seen that the revolute joint of the crank shaft (joint
"bearing" in left part of figure) might be selected as degree of
freedom. Then the 4 connector frames of all cylinders can be
computed. As a result the computations of the cylinders are
decoupled from each other. Within one cylinder the position of
frame_a and frame_b of the jointRRP assembly can be computed and
therefore the generalized coordinates of the two revolute and the
prismatic joint in the jointRRP object can be determined. From this
analysis it is not surprising that a Modelica translator, such as
Dymola, is able to transform the DAE equations into a sequential
evaluation without any non-linear loop. Compare this nice result
with the model using only elementary joints that leads to a DAE
with 6 algebraic loops and 5 non-linear equations per loop.
Additionally, a linear system of equations of order 43 is present.
The simulation time is about 5 times faster with the analytic loop
handling.</p>
