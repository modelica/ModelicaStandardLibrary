<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Model <b>World</b> represents a global coordinate system fixed
in ground. This model serves several purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is used as <b>inertial system</b> in which the equations of
all elements of the MultiBody library are defined.</li>
<li>It is the world frame of an <b>animation window</b> in which
all elements of the MultiBody library are visualized.</li>
<li>It is used to define the <b>gravity field</b> in which a
multi-body model is present. Default is a uniform gravity field
where the gravity acceleration vector g is the same at every
position. Additionally, a point gravity field or no gravity can be
selected. Also, function gravityAcceleration can be redeclared to a
user-defined function that computes the gravity acceleration, see
example <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Examples.Elementary.UserDefinedGravityField.html">
Examples.Elementary.UserDefinedGravityField</a>.</li>
<li>It is used to define <b>default settings</b> of animation
properties (e.g., the diameter of a sphere representing by default
the center of mass of a body, or the diameters of the cylinders
representing a revolute joint).</li>
<li>It is used to define a <b>visual representation</b> of the
world model (= 3 coordinate axes with labels) and of the defined
gravity field.<br />

</ul>
<p>Since the gravity field function is required from all bodies
with mass and the default settings of animation properties are
required from nearly every component, exactly one instance of model
World needs to be present in every model on the top level. The
basic declaration needs to be:</p>
<pre>
    <b>inner</b> Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.World world
</pre>
<p>Note, it must be an <b>inner</b> declaration with instance name
<b>world</b> in order that this world object can be accessed from
all objects in the model. When dragging the "World" object from the
package browser into the diagram layer, this declaration is
automatically generated (this is defined via annotations in model
World).</p>
<p>All vectors and tensors of a mechanical system are resolved in a
frame that is local to the corresponding component. Usually, if all
relative joint coordinates vanish, the local frames of all
components are parallel to each other, as well as to the world
frame (this holds as long as a Parts.FixedRotation, component is
<b>not</b> used). In this "reference configuration" it is therefore
alternatively possible to resolve all vectors in the world frame,
since all frames are parallel to each other. This is often very
convenient. In order to give some visual support in such a
situation, in the icon of a World instance two axes of the world
frame are shown and the labels of these axes can be set via
parameters.</p>
