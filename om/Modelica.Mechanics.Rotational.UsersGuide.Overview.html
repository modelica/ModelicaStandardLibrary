<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This package contains components to model <b>1-dimensional
rotational mechanical</b> systems, including different types of
gearboxes, shafts with inertia, external torques, spring/damper
elements, frictional elements, backlash, elements to measure angle,
angular velocity, angular acceleration and the cut-torque of a
flange. In sublibrary <b>Examples</b> several examples are present
to demonstrate the usage of the elements. Just open the
corresponding example model and simulate the model according to the
provided description.</p>
<p>A unique feature of this library is the
<b>component-oriented</b> modeling of <b>Coulomb friction</b>
elements, such as friction in bearings, clutches, brakes, and gear
efficiency. Even (dynamically) coupled friction elements, e.g., as
in automatic gearboxes, can be handled <b>without</b> introducing
stiffness which leads to fast simulations. The underlying theory is
new and is based on the solution of mixed continuous/discrete
systems of equations, i.e., equations where the <b>unknowns</b> are
of type <b>Real</b>, <b>Integer</b> or <b>Boolean</b>. Provided
appropriate numerical algorithms for the solution of such types of
systems are available in the simulation tool, the simulation of
(dynamically) coupled friction elements of this library is
<b>efficient</b> and <b>reliable</b>.</p>

<p>A simple example of the usage of this library is given in the
figure above. This drive consists of a shaft with inertia J1=0.2
which is connected via an ideal gearbox with gear ratio=5 to a
second shaft with inertia J2=5. The left shaft is driven via an
external, sinusoidal torque. The <b>filled</b> and <b>non-filled
grey squares</b> at the left and right side of a component
represent <b>mechanical flanges</b>. Drawing a line between such
squares means that the corresponding flanges are <b>rigidly
attached</b> to each other. By convention in this library, the
connector characterized as a <b>filled</b> grey square is called
<b>flange_a</b> and placed at the left side of the component in the
"design view" and the connector characterized as a
<b>non-filled</b> grey square is called <b>flange_b</b> and placed
at the right side of the component in the "design view". The two
connectors are completely <b>identical</b>, with the only exception
that the graphical layout is a little bit different in order to
distinguish them for easier access of the connector variables. For
example, <code>J1.flange_a.tau</code> is the cut-torque in the
connector <code>flange_a</code> of component <code>J1</code>.</p>
<p>The components of this library can be <b>connected</b> together
in an <b>arbitrary</b> way. E.g., it is possible to connect two
springs or two shafts with inertia directly together, see figure
below.</p>
