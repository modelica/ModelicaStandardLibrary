<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>The basic concept to count unknowns and equations.</p>
<p>Restrictions for model and block classes are present, in order
that missing or too many equations can be detected and localized by
a Modelica translator before using the respective model or block
class.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<pre>
   <b>partial model</b> BaseCorrelation
     <b>input</b> Real x;
     Real y;
   <b>end</b> BaseCorrelation;

   <b>model</b> SpecialCorrelation // correct in Modelica 2.2 and 3.0
      <b>extends</b> BaseCorrelation(x=2);
   <b>equation</b>
       y=2/x;
   <b>end</b> SpecialCorrelation;

   <b>model</b> UseCorrelation // correct according to Modelica 2.2
                        // not valid according to Modelica 3.0
      <b>replaceable model</b> Correlation=BaseCorrelation;
      Correlation correlation;
   <b>equation</b>
      correlation.y=time;
   <b>end</b> UseCorrelation;

   <b>model</b> Broken // after redeclaration, there is 1 equation too much in Modelica 2.2
      UseCorrelation example(redeclare Correlation=SpecialCorrelation);
   <b>end</b> Broken;
</pre>
<p>In this case one can argue that both UseCorrelation (adding an
acausal equation) and SpecialCorrelation (adding a default to an
input) are correct, but still when combined they lead to a model
with too many equations - and it is not possible to determine which
model is incorrect without strict rules. In Modelica 2.2, model
Broken will work with some models. However, by just redeclaring it
to model SpecialCorrelation, an error will occur and it will be
very difficult in a larger model to figure out the source of this
error. In Modelica 3.0, model UseCorrelation is no longer allowed
and the translator will give an error. In fact, it is guaranteed
that a redeclaration cannot lead to an unbalanced model any
more.</p>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The restrictions below apply after flattening " i.e., inherited
components are included " possibly modified.</p>
<p><b>Definition 1: Local Number of Unknowns</b></p>
<p>The local number of unknowns of a model or block class is the
sum based on the components:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each declared component of specialized class type (Real,
Integer, String, Boolean, enumeration and arrays of those, etc.) or
record, not declared as outer, it is the "number of unknown
variables" inside it (i.e., excluding parameters and constants and
counting the elements after expanding all records and arrays to a
set of scalars of primitive types).</li>
<li>Each declared component of specialized class type or record
declared as outer is ignored [i.e., all variables inside the
component are treated as known].</li>
<li>For each declared component of specialized class connector
component, it is the "number of unknown variables" inside it (i.e.,
excluding parameters and constants and counting the elements after
expanding all records and arrays to a set of scalars of primitive
types).</li>
<li>For each declared component of specialized class block or
model, it is the "sum of the number of inputs and flow variables"
in the (top level) public connector components of these components
(and counting the elements after expanding all records and arrays
to a set of scalars of primitive types).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Definition 2: Local Equation Size</b></p>
<p>The local equation size of a model or block class is the sum of
the following numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of equations defined locally (i.e., not in any model
or block component), including binding equations, and equations
generated from connect-equations. This includes the proper count
for when-clauses, and algorithms, and is also used for the flat
Hybrid DAE formulation.</li>
<li>The number of input and flow-variables present in each
(top-level) public connector component. [This represents the number
of connection equations that will be provided when the class is
used.]</li>
<li>The number of (top level) public input variables that neither
are connectors nor have binding equations [i.e., top-level inputs
are treated as known variables. This represents the number of
binding equations that will be provided when the class is used.].
[To clarify top-level inputs without binding equation (for
non-inherited inputs binding equation is identical to declaration
equation, but binding equations also include the case where another
model extends M and has a modifier on "u" giving the value):
<pre>
  model M
    input Real u;
    input Real u2=2;
  end M;
</pre>
Here "u" and "u2" are top-level inputs and not connectors. The
variable u2 has a binding equation, but u does not have a binding
equation. In the equation count, it is assumed that an equation for
u is supplied when using the model.]</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Definition 3: Locally Balanced</b></p>
<p>A model or block class is "locally balanced" if the "local
number of unknowns" is identical to the "local equation size" for
all legal values of constants and parameters [respecting final
bindings and min/max-restrictions. A tool shall verify the "locally
balanced" property for the actual values of parameters and
constants in the simulation model. It is a quality of
implementation for a tool to verify this property in general, due
to arrays of (locally) undefined sizes, conditional declarations,
for loops, etc.].</p>
<p><b>Definition 4: Globally Balanced</b></p>
<p>Similarly as locally balanced, but including all unknowns and
equations from all components. The global number of unknowns is
computed by expanding all unknowns (i.e., excluding parameters and
constants) into a set of scalars of primitive types. This should
match the global equation size defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of equations defined (included in any model or block
component), including equations generated from
connect-equations.</li>
<li>The number of input and flow-variables present in each
(top-level) public connector component.</li>
<li>The number of (top level) public input variables that neither
are connectors nor have binding equations [i.e., top-level inputs
are treated as known variables].</li>
</ul>
<p>The following restrictions hold:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a non-partial model or block, all non-connector inputs of
model or block components must have binding equations. [E.g., if
the model contains a component, firstOrder (of specialized class
model) and firstOrder has "input Real u" then there must be a
binding equation for firstOrder.u.]</li>
<li>A component declared with the inner or outer prefix shall not
be of a class having top-level public connectors containing
inputs.</li>
<li>Modifiers for components shall only contain redeclarations of
replaceable elements and binding equations for parameters,
constants (that do not yet have binding equations), inputs and
variables having a default binding equation.</li>
<li>All non-partial model and block classes must be locally
balanced [this means that the local number of unknowns equals the
local equation size].</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these restrictions, the following strong guarantee can
be given for simulation models and blocks:</p>
<p><b>Proposition 1: All simulation models and blocks are globally
balanced.</b><br />
[Therefore the number of unknowns equal to the number of equations
of a simulation model or block, provided that every used
non-partial model or block class is locally balanced.]</p>
<pre>
Example 1:

connector Pin
   Real v;
   flow Real i;
end Pin;

model Capacitor
   parameter Real C;
   Pin  p, n;
   Real u;
equation
   0 = p.i + n.i;
   u = p.v - n.v;
   C*der(u) = p.i;
end Capacitor;
</pre>
<p>Model Capacitor is a locally balanced model according to the
following analysis:</p>
<pre>
Locally unknown variables: p.i, p.v, n.i, n.v, u
Local equations:  0 = p.i + n.i;
                  u = p.v - n.v;
                  C*der(u) = p.i;
                  and 2 equations corresponding to the
                  2 flow-variables p.i and n.i.
</pre>
<p>These are 5 equations in 5 unknowns (locally balanced model). A
more detailed analysis would reveal that this is structurally
non-singular, i.e., that the hybrid DAE will not contain a
singularity independent of actual values. If the equation "u = p.v
- n.v" would be missing in the Capacitor model, there would be 4
equations in 5 unknowns and the model would be locally unbalanced
and thus simulation models in which this model is used would be
usually structurally singular and thus not solvable. If the
equation "u = p.v - n.v" would be replaced by the equation "u = 0"
and the equation C*der(u) = p.i would be replaced by the equation
"C*der(u) = 0", there would be 5 equations in 5 unknowns (locally
balanced), but the equations would be singular, regardless of how
the equations corresponding to the flow-variables are constructed
because the information that "u" is constant is given twice in a
slightly different form.</p>
<pre>
Example 2:

connector Pin
   Real v;
   flow Real i;
end Pin;

partial model TwoPin
   Pin p,n;
end TwoPin;

model Capacitor
   parameter Real C;
   extends TwoPin;
   Real u;
equation
   0 = p.i + n.i;
   u = p.v " n.v;
   C*der(u) = p.i;
end Capacitor;

model Circuit
   extends TwoPin;
   replaceable TwoPin t;
   Capacitor c(C=12);
equation
   connect(p, t.p);
   connect(t.n, c.p);
   connect(c.n, n);
end Circuit;
</pre>
<p>Since t is partial we cannot check whether this is a globally
balanced model, but we can check that Circuit is locally balanced.
Counting on model Circuit results in the following balance
sheet:</p>
<pre>
Locally unknown variables (8): p.i, p.v, n.i, n.v, and 2 flow variables for t (t.p.i, t.n.i)
                                                   and 2 flow variable for c (c.p.i, c.n.i).
Local equations:     p.v = t.p.v;
                       0 = p.i - t.p.i;
                   c.p.v = load.n.v;
                       0 = c.p.i+load.n.i;
                     n.v = c.n.v;
                       0 = n.i - c.n.i;
                    and 2 equation corresponding to the
                    flow variables p.i, n.i
</pre>
<p>In total we have 8 scalar unknowns and 8 scalar equations, i.e.,
a locally balanced model (and this feature holds for any models
used for the replaceable component "t"). Some more analysis reveals
that this local set of equations and unknowns is structurally
non-singular. However, this does not provide any guarantees for the
global set of equations, and specific combinations of models that
are "locally non-singular" may lead to a globally non-singular
model.]</p>
<pre>
Example 3:

import SI = Modelica.SIunits;
partial model BaseProperties
   "Interface of medium model for all type of media"
   parameter Boolean preferredMediumStates=false;
   constant  Integer nXi "Number of independent mass fractions";
   InputAbsolutePressure     p;
   InputSpecificEnthalpy     h;
   InputMassFraction         Xi[nXi];
   SI.Temperature            T;
   SI.Density                d;
   SI.SpecificInternalEnergy u;

   connector InputAbsolutePressure = input SI.AbsolutePressure;
   connector InputSpecificEnthalpy = input SI.SpecificEnthalpy;
   connector InputMassFraction = input SI.MassFraction;
end BaseProperties;
</pre>
<p>The use of connector here is a special design pattern. The
variables p, h, Xi are marked as input to get correct equation
count. Since they are connectors they should neither be given
binding equations in derived classes nor when using the model. The
design pattern is to give textual equations for them (as below);
using connect-statements for these connectors would be possible
(and would work) but is not part of the design. This partial model
defines that T,d,u can be computed from the medium model, provided
p,h,Xi are given. Every medium with one or multiple substances and
one or multiple phases, including incompressible media, has the
property that T,d,u can be computed from p,h,Xi. A particular
medium may have different "independent variables" from which all
other intrinsic thermodynamic variables can be recursively
computed. For example, a simple air model could be defined as:</p>
<pre>
model SimpleAir "Medium model of simple air. Independent variables: p,T"
   extends BaseProperties(nXi = 0,
        p(stateSelect = if preferredMediumStates then StateSelect.prefer
                                   else StateSelect.default),
        T(stateSelect = if preferredMediumStates then StateSelect.prefer
                                   else StateSelect.default));
   constant SI.SpecificHeatCapacity R  = 287;
   constant SI.SpecificHeatCapacity cp = 1005.45;
   constant SI.Temperature          T0 = 298.15
equation
   d = p/(R*T);
   h = cp*(T-T0);
   u = h " p/d;
end SimpleAir;
</pre>
<p>The local number of unknowns in model SimpleAir (after
flattening) is:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 (T, d, u: variables defined in BaseProperties and inherited
in SimpleAir), plus</li>
<li>2+nXi (p, h, Xi: variables inside connectors defined in
BaseProperties and inherited in SimpleAir) resulting in 5+nXi
unknowns.</li>
</ul>
<p>The local equation size is:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 (equations defined in SimpleAir), plus</li>
<li>2+nXi (input variables in the connectors inherited from
BaseProperties)</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the model is locally balanced. The generic medium
model BaseProperties is used as a replaceable model in different
components, like a dynamic volume or a fixed boundary
condition:</p>
<pre>
import SI = Modelica.SIunits
connector FluidPort
  replaceable model Medium = BaseProperties;

  SI.AbsolutePressure  p;
  flow SI.MassFlowRate m_flow;

  SI.SpecificEnthalpy      h;
  flow SI.EnthalpyFlowRate H_flow;

  SI.MassFraction       Xi     [Medium.nXi] "Independent mixture mass fractions";
  flow SI.MassFlowRate mXi_flow[Medium.nXi] "Independent substance mass flow rates";
end FluidPort;

model DynamicVolume
   parameter SI.Volume V;
   replaceable model Medium = BaseProperties;
   FluidPort port(redeclare model Medium = Medium);
   Medium    medium(preferredMediumStates=true); // No modifier for p,h,Xi
   SI.InternalEnergy U;
   SI.Mass           M;
   SI.Mass           MXi[medium.nXi];
equation
   U   = medium.u*M;
   M   = medium.d*V;
   MXi = medium.Xi*M;
   der(U)   = port.H_flow;   // Energy balance
   der(M)   = port.m_flow;   // Mass balance
   der(MXi) = port.mXi_flow; // Substance mass balance

// Equations binding to medium (inputs)
   medium.p  = port.p;
   medium.h  = port.h;
   medium.Xi = port.Xi;
end DynamicVolume;
</pre>
<p>The local number of unknowns of DynamicVolume is:</p>
<ul>
<li>4+2*nXi (inside the port connector), plus</li>
<li>2+nXi (variables U, M and MXi), plus</li>
<li>2+nXi (the input variables in the connectors of the medium
model)</li>
</ul>
<p>resulting in 8+4*nXi unknowns; the local equation size is</p>
<ul>
<li>6+3*nXi from the equation section, plus</li>
<li>2+nXi flow variables in the port connector.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, DynamicVolume is a locally balanced model. Note, when
the DynamicVolume is used and the Medium model is redeclared to
"SimpleAir", then a tool will try to select p,T as states, since
these variables have StateSelect.prefer in the SimpleAir model
(this means that the default states U,M are derived quantities). If
this state selection is performed, all intrinsic medium variables
are computed from medium.p and medium.T, although p and h are the
input arguments to the medium model. This demonstrates that in
Modelica input/output does not define the computational causality.
Instead, it defines that equations have to be provided here for
p,h,Xi, in order that the equation count is correct. The actual
computational causality can be different as it is demonstrated with
the SimpleAir model.</p>
<pre>
model FixedBoundary_pTX
   parameter SI.AbsolutePressure p "Predefined boundary pressure";
   parameter SI.Temperature      T "Predefined boundary temperature";
   parameter SI.MassFraction     Xi[medium.nXi]
                                   "Predefined boundary mass fraction";
   replaceable model Medium = BaseProperties;
   FluidPort port(redeclare model Medium = Medium);
   Medium medium;
equation
   port.p        = p;
   port.H_flow   = semiLinear(port.m_flow, port.h , medium.h);
   port.MXi_flow = semiLinear(port.m_flow, port.Xi, medium.Xi);

// Equations binding to medium (note: T is not an input).
   medium.p  = p;
   medium.T  = T;
   medium.Xi = Xi;
end FixedBoundary_pTX;
</pre>
<p>The number of local variables in FixedBoundary_pTX is:</p>
<ul>
<li>4+2*nXi (inside the port connector), plus</li>
<li>2+nXi (the input variables in the connectors of the medium
model)</li>
</ul>
<p>resulting in 6+3*nXi unknowns, while the local equation size
is</p>
<ul>
<li>4+2*nXi from the equation section, plus</li>
<li>2+nXi flow variables in the port connector.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, FixedBoundary_pTX is a locally balanced model. The
predefined boundary variables p and Xi are provided via equations
to the input arguments medium.p and medium.Xi, in addition there is
an equation for T in the same way " even though T is not an input.
Depending on the flow direction, either the specific enthalpy in
the port (port.h) or h is used to compute the enthalpy flow rate
H_flow. "h" is provided as binding equation to the medium. With the
equation "medium.T = T", the specific enthalpy "h" of the reservoir
is indirectly computed via the medium equations. Again, this
demonstrates, that an "input" just defines the number of equations
have to be provided, but that it not necessarily defines the
computational causality.</p>
