<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Maintenance of the Modelica Standard Library is performed with
three branches on the subversion server of the Modelica Association
(<a href="https://svn.modelica.org/projects/Modelica">https://svn.modelica.org/projects/Modelica</a>):</p>
<h4>Released branch</h4>
<p>Example: "/tags/v3.0.1/Modelica"</p>
<p>This branch contains the released Modelica versions (e.g.,
version 3.0.1), where all available test cases and compatibility
checks with other Modelica libraries have been performed on the
respective release. This version is usually shipped with a Modelica
modeling and simulation environment and utilized by a Modelica
user.</p>
<h4>Development branch</h4>
<p>Example: "/trunk/Modelica"</p>
<p>This branch contains the actual development version, i.e., all
bug fixes and new features based on the last Modelica release. New
features should have been tested before including them. However,
the exhaustive tests for a new version are (usually) not performed.
This version is usually only be used by the developers of the
Modelica Standard Library and is not utilized by Modelica
users.</p>
<h4>Maintenance branch</h4>
<p>Example: "/branches/maintenance/3.0.1/Modelica"</p>
<p>This branch contains the released Modelica version (e.g.,
version 3.0.1) where all bug fixes since this release date are
included (up to a new release, when becoming available; i.e., after
a new release, the previous maintenance versions are no longer
changed). These bug fixes might be not yet tested with all test
cases or with other Modelica libraries. The goal is that a vendor
may take this version at any time for a new release of its
software, in order to incorporate the latest bug fixes, without
changing the version number of the Modelica Standard Library.</p>
<p>Incorporation of bug fixes (subversion "commit") shall be
performed in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>One person is fixing the bug and another person is checking
whether the fix is fine.</li>
<li>It is up to the library developer, whether he opens a new
branch for testing and then merges it with the "head" maintenance
branch or not.</li>
<li>Every change to the maintenance branch has to be done at the
development branch (see above) as well. One exception are pure
changes to the "versionBuild" annotation as these have no meaning
in the development trunk.</li>
<li>Every change to the maintenance branch requires introducing a
description of the bug fix under
Modelica.UsersGuide.ReleaseNotes.Version_&lt;release-number&gt;_BugFixes.</li>
<li>Annotations "version" and "versionDate" must <u>not</u> be
changed in a maintenance release.</li>
<li>Every change to the maintenance branch requires changing the
"versionBuild" number (incrementing it by one), as well as the
"dateModified" field.<br />
Example:
<pre>
  annotation(version      = "3.1",
             versionDate  = "2009-06-22",
             versionBuild = 3,
             dateModified = "2009-08-28 07:40:19Z",
             revisionId   = "$I​d::                                       $")
</pre>
The "revisionId" field is a bit special though. If written like in
the example above it will be automatically expanded to:
<pre>
             revisionId   = "$I​d:: package.mo 2879 2009-08-28 07:40:19Z #$"
</pre>
by the subversion checkout procedure.</li>
<li>If time does not permit, a vendor makes the bug fix in its
local version and then has to include it in the maintenance
version. It would be best to make these changes at a new branch in
order to get a unique release number.</li>
</ul>
<p>A valid "commit" to the maintenance branch may contain one or
more of the following changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Correcting an equation.</li>
<li>Correcting attributes quantity/unit/defaultUnit in a
declaration.</li>
<li>Improving/fixing the documentation.</li>
<li>Introducing a new name in the public section of a class (model,
package, ...) or in any section of a partial class is <b>not</b>
allowed. Since otherwise, a user might use this new name and when
storing its model and loading it with an older build-version, an
error would occur.</li>
<li>Introducing a new name in the protected section of a
non-partial class should only be done if absolutely necessary to
fix a bug. The problem is that this might be non-backward
compatible, because a user might already extend from this class and
already using the same name.</li>
</ul>
