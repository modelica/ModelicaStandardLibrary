<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This element consists of a <b>backlash</b> element <b>connected
in series</b> to a <b>spring</b> and <b>damper</b> element which
are <b>connected in parallel</b>. The spring constant shall be
non-zero, otherwise the component cannot be used.</p>
<p>In combination with components IdealGear, the ElastoBacklash
model can be used to model a gear box with backlash, elasticity and
damping.</p>
<p>During initialization, the backlash characteristic is replaced
by a continuous approximation in the backlash region, in order to
reduce problems during initialization, especially for inverse
models.</p>
<p>If the backlash b is smaller as 1e-10 rad (especially, if b=0),
then the backlash is ignored and the component reduces to a
spring/damper element in parallel.</p>
<p>In the backlash region (-b/2 ≤ flange_b.phi - flange_a.phi -
phi_rel0 ≤ b/2) no torque is exerted (flange_b.tau = 0). Outside of
this region, contact is present and the contact torque is basically
computed with a linear spring/damper characteristic:</p>
<pre>
   desiredContactTorque = c*phi_contact + d*<b>der</b>(phi_contact)

            phi_contact = phi_rel - phi_rel0 - b/2 <b>if</b> phi_rel - phi_rel0 &gt;  b/2
                        = phi_rel - phi_rel0 + b/2 <b>if</b> phi_rel - phi_rel0 &lt; -b/2

            phi_rel     = flange_b.phi - flange_a.phi;
</pre>
<p>This torque characteristic leads to the following
difficulties:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the damper torque becomes larger as the spring torque and
with opposite sign, the contact torque would be "pulling/sticking"
which is unphysical, since during contact only pushing torques can
occur.</li>
<li>When contact occurs with a non-zero relative speed (which is
the usual situation), the damping torque has a non-zero value and
therefore the contact torque changes discontinuously at phi_rel =
phi_rel0. Again, this is not physical because the torque can only
change continuously. (Note, this component is not an idealized
model where a steep characteristic is approximated by a
discontinuity, but it shall model the steep characteristic.)</li>
</ol>
<p>In the literature there are several proposals to fix problem
(2). However, there seems to be no proposal to avoid sticking. For
this reason, the most simple approach is used in the ElastoBacklash
model, to fix both problems by slight changes to the linear
spring/damper characteristic:</p>
<pre>
    // Torque characteristic when phi_rel &gt; phi_rel0
    <b>if</b> phi_rel - phi_rel0 &lt; b/2 <b>then</b>
       tau_c = 0;          // spring torque
       tau_d = 0;          // damper torque
       flange_b.tau = 0;
    <b>else</b>
       tau_c = c*(phi_rel - phi_rel0);    // spring torque
       tau_d = d*<b>der</b>(phi_rel);            // damper torque
       flange_b.tau = <b>if</b> tau_c + tau_d ≤ 0 <b>then</b> 0 <b>else</b> tau_c + <b>min</b>( tau_c, tau_d );
    <b>end if</b>;
</pre>
<p>Note, when sticking would occur (tau_c + tau_d ≤ 0), then the
contact torque is explicitly set to zero. The "min(tau_c, tau_d)"
part in the if-expression, limits the damping torque when it is
pushing. This means that at the start of the contact (phi_rel -
phi_rel0 = b/2), the damping torque is zero and is continuous. The
effect of both modifications is that the absolute value of the
damping torque is always limited by the absolute value of the
spring torque: |tau_d| ≤ |tau_c|.</p>
<p>In the next figure, a typical simulation with the ElastoBacklash
model is shown (<a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Examples.Backlash.html">Examples.Backlash</a>)
where the different effects are visualized:</p>
<ol>
<li>Curve 1 (elastoBacklash1.tau) is the unmodified contact torque,
i.e., the linear spring/damper characteristic. A pulling/sticking
torque is present at the end of the contact.</li>
<li>Curve 2 (elastoBacklash2.tau) is the contact torque, where the
torque is explicitly set to zero when pulling/sticking occurs. The
contact torque is discontinuous at begin of contact.</li>
<li>Curve 3 (elastoBacklash3.tau) is the ElastoBacklash model of
this library. No discontinuity and no pulling/sticking occurs.</li>
</ol>
