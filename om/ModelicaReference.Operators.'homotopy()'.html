<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>During the initialization phase of a dynamic simulation problem,
it often happens that large nonlinear systems of equations must be
solved by means of an iterative solver. The convergence of such
solvers critically depends on the choice of initial guesses for the
unknown variables. The process can be made more robust by providing
an alternative, simplified version of the model, such that
convergence is possible even without accurate initial guess values,
and then by continuously transforming the simplified model into the
actual model. This transformation can be formulated using
expressions of this kind:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
lambda*actual + (1-lambda)*simplified
</pre></blockquote>
<p>in the formulation of the system equations, and is usually
called a homotopy transformation. If the simplified expression is
chosen carefully, the solution of the problem changes continuously
with lambda, so by taking small enough steps it is possible to
eventually obtain the solution of the actual problem.</p>
<p>It is recommended to perform (conceptually) one homotopy
iteration over the whole model, and not several homotopy iterations
over the respective non-linear algebraic equation systems. The
reason is that the following structure can be present:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<strong>w = f<sub>1</sub>(x)</strong> // has homotopy operator
<strong>0 = f<sub>2</sub>(der(x), x, z, w)</strong>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Here, a non-linear equation system
<strong><code>f<sub>2</sub></code></strong> is present. The
homotopy operator is, however used on a variable that is an 'input'
to the non-linear algebraic equation system, and modifies the
characteristics of the non-linear algebraic equation system. The
only useful way is to perform the homotopy iteration over
<strong><code>f<sub>1</sub></code></strong> and
<strong><code>f<sub>2</sub></code></strong> together.</p>
<p>The suggested approach is 'conceptual', because more efficient
implementations are possible, e.g., by determining the smallest
iteration loop, that contains the equations of the first BLT block
in which a homotopy operator is present and all equations up to the
last BLT block that describes a non-linear algebraic equation
system.</p>
<p>A trivial implementation of the homotopy operator is obtained by
defining the following function in the globalscope:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<strong>function</strong> homotopy
  <strong>input</strong> Real actual;
  <strong>input</strong> Real simplified;
  <strong>output</strong> Real y;
<strong>algorithm</strong>
  y := actual;
  <strong>annotation</strong>(Inline = true);
<strong>end</strong> homotopy;
</pre></blockquote>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<strong>homotopy</strong>(actual=actual, simplified=simplified)
</pre></blockquote>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The scalar expressions 'actual' and 'simplified' are subtypes of
Real. A Modelica translator should map this operator into either of
the two forms:</p>
<ol>
<li>Returns 'actual' <em>[a trivial implementation]</em>.</li>
<li>
<p>In order to solve algebraic systems of equations, the operator
might during the solution process return a combination of the two
arguments, ending at actual, <em>e.g.,</em></p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<em>
actual*lambda + simplified*(1-lambda),
</em>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>where <code>lambda</code> is a homotopy parameter going from 0
to 1.</p>
<p>The solution must fulfill the equations for homotopy returning
'actual'.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<h5>Example 1</h5>
<p>In electrical systems it is often difficult to solve non-linear
algebraic equations if switches are part of the algebraic loop. An
idealized diode model might be implemented in the following way, by
starting with a 'flat' diode characteristic and then move with the
homotopy operator to the desired 'steep' characteristic:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<strong>model</strong> IdealDiode
  ...
  <strong>parameter</strong> Real Goff = 1e-5;
<strong>protected</strong>
  <strong>Real</strong> Goff_flat = max(0.01, Goff);
  <strong>Real</strong> Goff2;
<strong>equation</strong>
  off = s &lt; 0;
  Goff2 = <strong>homotopy</strong>(actual=Goff, simplified=Goff_flat);
  u = s*(<strong>if</strong> off <strong>then</strong> 1     <strong>else</strong> Ron2) + Vknee;
  i = s*(<strong>if</strong> off <strong>then</strong> Goff2 <strong>else</strong> 1   ) + Goff2*Vknee;
  ...
<strong>end</strong> IdealDiode;
</pre></blockquote>
<h5>Example 2</h5>
<p>In electrical systems it is often useful that all voltage
sources start with zero voltage and all current sources with zero
current, since steady state initialization with zero sources can be
easily obtained. A typical voltage source would then be defined
as:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<strong>model</strong> ConstantVoltageSource
  <strong>extends</strong> Modelica.Electrical.Analog.Interfaces.OnePort;
  <strong>parameter</strong> Modelica.SIunits.Voltage V;
<strong>equation</strong>
  v = <strong>homotopy</strong>(actual=V, simplified=0.0);
<strong>end</strong> ConstantVoltageSource;
</pre></blockquote>
<h5>Example 3</h5>
<p>In fluid system modelling, the pressure/flowrate relationships
are highly nonlinear due to the quadratic terms and due to the
dependency on fluid properties. A simplified linear model, tuned on
the nominal operating point, can be used to make the overall model
less nonlinear and thus easier to solve without accurate start
values. Named arguments are used here in order to further improve
the readability.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<strong>model</strong> PressureLoss
  <strong>import</strong> SI = Modelica.SIunits;
  ...
  <strong>parameter</strong> SI.MassFlowRate m_flow_nominal "Nominal mass flow rate";
  <strong>parameter</strong> SI.Pressure     dp_nominal     "Nominal pressure drop";
  SI.Density                rho            "Upstream density";
  SI.DynamicViscosity       lambda         "Upstream viscosity";
<strong>equation</strong>
  ...
  m_flow = <strong>homotopy</strong>(actual     = turbulentFlow_dp(dp, rho, lambda),
                    simplified = dp/dp_nominal*m_flow_nominal);
  ...
<strong>end</strong> PressureLoss;
</pre></blockquote>
<h5>Example 4</h5>
<p>Note that the homotopy operator <strong>shall not</strong> be
used to combine unrelated expressions, since this can generate
singular systems from combining two well-defined systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<strong>model</strong> DoNotUse
  Real x;
  <strong>parameter</strong> Real x0 = 0;
<strong>equation</strong>
  der(x) = 1-x;
<strong>initial equation</strong>
  0 = <strong>homotopy</strong>(der(x), x - x0);
<strong>end</strong> DoNotUse;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>The initial equation is expanded into</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
0 = lambda*der(x) + (1-lambda)*(x-x0)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>and you can solve the two equations to give</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
x = (lambda+(lambda-1)*x0)/(2*lambda - 1)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>which has the correct value of <code>x0</code> at <code>lambda =
0</code> and of <code>1</code> at <code>lambda = 1</code>, but
unfortunately has a singularity at <code>lambda = 0.5</code>.</p>
