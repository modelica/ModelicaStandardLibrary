<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>If different versions of the MultiBody library are not
compatible to each other, corresponding conversion scripts are
provided. As a result, models build with an older version of the
MultiBody library are automatically converted to the new version
when the model is loaded. The user is prompted whether automatic
conversion shall take place or not. Problems are not to be
expected. Still one should first make a copy of such a model as
backup before the conversion is performed.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade from ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody</b></p>
<p>There is now also a conversion script from the "old"
<b>ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody</b> library to the "new"
Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody library. This script is also
automatically invoked. Since the differences between the "old" and
the "new" MultiBody library are so large, not everything is
converted and it might be that some pieces have to be adapted
manually. Still, this script is useful, since many class names,
parameters and modifiers are automatically converted.</p>
<p>Components from the following sublibraries are automatically
converted to the Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody library:</p>
<ul>
<li>ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody.Parts</li>
<li>ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody.Joints</li>
<li>ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody.Forces</li>
<li>Part of ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody.Interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>Models using the ModelicaAdditions.MultiBody library that are
programmed with <b>equations</b> are only partly converted: The
Frame connectors will be converted to the "new" Frame connectors of
the MultiBody library, but the equations that reference variables
of the Frame connectors will <b>not</b> be converted. For a manual
conversion, the following table might be helpful showing how the
<b>variables</b> of the "old" and the "new" <b>Frame connectors</b>
are related to each other (resolve2 and angularVelocity2 are
functions from library Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Frames):</p>

<p><b>Upgrade from MultiBody 0.99 (and earlier) to 1.0 (and
later)</b></p>
<p>The conversion from MultiBody 0.99 to 1.0 does not work in some
rare cases, where own components are implemented using functions of
the MultiBody.Frames package. In this case, the conversion has to
be performed manually. The changes in 1.0 with regards to 0.99
are:</p>
<p>The definition of the
Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Frames.Orientation object has changed.
In 0.99 this was just an alias type for a transformation matrix
(now
Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Frames.TransformationMatrices.Orientation).
In 1.0 the orientation object is a record holding the
transformation matrix from frame 1 to frame 2 and the angular
velocity of the transformation matrix resolved in frame 2. The
reason is that this allows to compute the angular velocity in many
cases by standard recursive formulas and not by differentiation of
the transformation matrix. This is usually much more efficient. As
a consequence, the following calls in 0.99 should be changed:</p>
<pre>
   Frames.angularVelocity1(T,der(T)) -&gt; Frames.angularVelocity1(T)
   Frames.angularVelocity2(T,der(T)) -&gt; Frames.angularVelocity2(T)
   Frames.from_T(T)                  -&gt; Frames.from_T2(T,der(T))
</pre>
