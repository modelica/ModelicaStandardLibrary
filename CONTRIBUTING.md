Thanks for considering to contribute to the Modelica Standard Library.

Contributing can be done by either filing an issue or by contributing code.

When filing an issue, please include all information necessary to reproduce,
and state what package is affected.

The workflow for contributing code depends on whether you are a collaborator 
with push rights, or an outside collaborator.

The [workflow for outside collaborators](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) is usually as follows:  

1. Fork the repository to your account by [using the `Fork` button](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
2. Clone the forked repository to your computer.
3. Create a new topic branch and give it a meaningful name, 
   like e.g. `issue2161_contributing`.
4. Do your code changes and commit them, one change per commit. 
   Single commits can be copied to other branches.
   Multiple commits can be squashed into one, but splitting is difficult.
5. Once you are done, push your branch to your fork.
6. Go to the upstream Modelica repository and submit a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) (PR).
   Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential 
   changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before the changes are 
   merged into the repository.
7. Update your branch with the requested changes. If necessary, merge the latest
   master into your branch and solve all merge conflicts in your branch.
